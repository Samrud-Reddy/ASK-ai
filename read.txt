 Introduction

This book covers the entire syllabus of Cambridge International AS & A Level Chemistry (9701) for examination from 2022. This book is in three parts:

Chapters 1-18 and P1: the AS Level content, covered in the first year of the course, including a chapter (P1) dedicated to the development of your practical skills

Chapters 19-30 and P2: the A Level content, including a chapter (P2) dedicated to developing your ability to plan, analyse and evaluate practical investigations

Appendices: including a Periodic Table, useful formulae and reactions, a glossary and an index.

The main aims of a textbook like this are to explain the various concepts of chemistry that you need to understand, and to provide you with questions that will help you to test your understanding and develop the key skills needed to succeed on this course. The ‘How to use this book’ pages show the structure of each chapter and the features of this book.

In your study of chemistry, you will find that certain key concepts are repeated, and that these concepts form ‘themes’ that link the different areas of chemistry together. You will progress and gain confidence in your understanding of chemistry if you take note of these themes. For this coursebook, these key concepts include:

Atoms and forces Experiments and evidence Patterns in chemical behaviour and reactions Chemical bonds Energy changes Studying chemistry is a stimulating and worthwhile experience. It is an international subject; no single country has a monopoly on the development of the ideas. It can be a rewarding exercise to discover how

men and women from many countries have contributed to our knowledge and well-being, through their research into and application of the concepts of chemistry.
