and neutrons and state that electrons are found in shells in the space around the nucleus

explain why isotopes of the same element have the same chemical properties

explain why isotopes of the same element have different physical properties (limited to mass and density).

BEFORE YOU START
1

Without looking at the Periodic Table, make a list of the names and symbols for the elements in
Periods 1, 2 and 3. Compare your list with another learner then check to see if the symbols are
correct.

2

How can you deduce the formula of a simple ion (e.g. a chloride ion or an aluminium ion) by
reference to the Periodic Table?

3

Take turns in challenging another learner to write down the formula of a simple ion. Check your
answers afterwards using a textbook.

4

Make a list of the subatomic particles in an atom giving their relative mass and relative charges as
well as their position in the atom, structure of the atom and isotopes. Compare your answers with
those of another learner. Were you in agreement?

5

Write down a definition of the term isotope. Put a circle around the three most important words in
your definition. Compare your definition to the one in a textbook.

6

What do the terms mass number and proton number mean? Write down your definitions and
compare yours with another learner.

7

Ask another learner to use a data book or the internet to select an isotope. Use this data to deduce
the number of protons, neutrons and electrons in an atom or ion of this isotope, e.g. Cr atom or
Cr3+ ion. If you are unsure, check your answer with someone else in the class or with a teacher.

8

Take a photocopy of the modern Periodic Table and cross out or cut out the group numbers and
period numbers. Get another learner to select an element. You then have to state in which period
and group that element belongs. Take turns in doing this until you are sure that you can easily
identify the group and period of an element.

9

Ask another learner to select an element. You then have to state if the element is a metal, nonmetal or metalloid (metalloids have some characteristics of both metals and non-metals). If you are
both uncertain, consult a textbook or the internet. Take turns in doing this until you are sure that
you can easily identify the position of metals, non-metals and metalloids.

10 Explain to another learner in terms of numbers of electrons and protons why a sodium ion has a
single positive charge but an oxide ion has a 2− charge.
11 Explain to another learner what you know about attraction or repulsion of positive and negative
charges.

DEVELOPING AN IDEA: NANOMACHINES
Progress in science depends not only on original thinking but also on developing the ideas of other
people. The idea of an atom goes back over 2000 years to the Greek philosopher Demokritos. About
350 years ago, Robert Boyle looked again at the idea of small particles but there was no proof. John
Dalton moved a step closer to proving that atoms exist: he developed the idea that atoms of the same
kind had the same weight, thinking this could explain the results of experiments on combining
different substances in terms of rearrangement of the atoms.
At the beginning of the 20th century, J.J. Thomson (see Figure 1.6) suggested three models of the
atom. His preferred model was to imagine an atom as a spherical cloud of positive charge in which
electrons were placed. A few years later, scientists working under the direction of Ernest Rutherford
(see Figure 1.4) fired alpha particles (which we now know are positively charged helium nuclei) at very
high speeds at strips of metal only 0.0005 mm thick. Most of the alpha particles went through the
strip. This would fit with the idea of atoms being a cloud of charge with very little mass to deflect
(change the direction of) the alpha particles. But one alpha particle in every 20 000 was deflected at
an angle of more than 90°. From this, Rutherford deduced that there must be something very small
and positively charged in the atom. The atomic nucleus had been discovered!
In 1960 Richard Feynman (Figure 1.1) suggested that tiny machines could be made from a few
hundred atoms grouped together in clusters. At the time, these ideas seemed like ‘science fiction’. But
several scientists took up the challenge and the science of nanotechnology was born.

Figure 1.1: Richard Feynman.

In nanotechnology, scientists design and make objects that may have a thickness of only a few
thousand atoms or less. Groups of atoms can be moved around on special surfaces (Figure 1.2). In this
way, scientists have started to develop tiny machines that will help deliver medical drugs to exactly
where they are needed in the body.

Figure 1.2: Each of the blue peaks in this image is an individual molecule. The molecules can be moved over a
copper surface, making this a molecular abacus or counting device.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Why do you think that tiny clusters of atoms are useful for catalysts?
How do you think that you could make tiny clusters of metal atoms on a cold surface?
Tip: Think about breathing onto a cold surface.
What other uses could be made of tiny groups / clusters of atoms?
What advantages and disadvantages could there be in using tiny clusters of atoms to help deliver
medical drugs and in cancer treatment?
What else do you think nanomachines could be used for?

1.1 Elements and atoms
Every substance in our world is made up from chemical elements. These chemical elements cannot be
broken down further into simpler substances by chemical means. A few elements, such as nitrogen and
gold, are found on their own in nature, not combined with other elements. Most elements, however, are
found in combination with other elements as compounds.
Every element has its own chemical symbol. The symbols are often derived from Latin or Greek words.
Some examples are shown in Table 1.1.
Element

Symbol

C

lithium

Li (from Greek ‘lithos’)

iron

Fe (from Latin ‘ferrum’)

potassium

K (from Arabic ‘al-qualyah’ or from the Latin ‘kalium’)

Table 1.1: Some examples of chemical symbols.

Chemical elements contain only one type of atom. An atom is the smallest part of an element that can
take part in a chemical change. Atoms are very small. The diameter of a hydrogen atom is approximately
10−10 m, so the mass of an atom is also very small. A single hydrogen atom weighs only 1.67 × 10−27 kg.

1.2 Inside the atom
The structure of an atom
Every atom has nearly all of its mass concentrated in a tiny region in the centre of the atom called the
nucleus. The nucleus is made up of particles called nucleons. There are two types of nucleon: protons and
neutrons. Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons.
Outside the nucleus, particles called electrons move around in regions of space called orbitals (see
Section 2.3). Chemists often find it convenient to use a simpler model of the atom in which electrons move
around the nucleus in electron shells. Each shell is a certain distance from the nucleus at its own particular
energy level (see Section 2.3). In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of
protons. A simple model of a carbon atom is shown in Figure 1.3.

Figure 1.3: A model of a carbon atom. This model is not very accurate but it is useful for understanding what happens to
the electrons during chemical reactions.

IMPORTANT
When we use a simple model of the atom we talk about shells (n = 1, n = 2, etc) and sub-shells 2s, 2p,
etc. In this model, the electrons are at a fixed distance from the nucleus. This model is useful when we
discuss ionisation energies (Chapter 2).
When we discuss where the electrons really are in space, we use the orbital model. In this model, there is a
probability of finding a particular electron within certain area of space outside the nucleus. We use this
model for discussing bonding and referring to electrons in the sub-shells.
Atoms are tiny, but the nucleus of an atom is much smaller. If the diameter of an atom were the size of a
football stadium, the nucleus would only be the size of a pea. This means that most of the atom is empty
space! Electrons are even smaller than protons and neutrons.

Figure 1.4: Ernest Rutherford (left) and Hans Geiger (right) using their alpha particle apparatus. Interpretation of the
results led to Rutherford proposing the nuclear model for atoms.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 1.1
Experiments with subatomic particles
We can deduce the electric charge of subatomic particles by showing how beams of electrons, protons
and neutrons behave in electric fields. If we fire a beam of electrons past electrically charged plates,
the electrons are deflected (change direction) away from the negative plate and towards the positive
plate (Figure 1.5a). This shows us that the electrons are negatively charged because opposite charges
attract each other and like charges repel each other.
A cathode-ray tube (Figure 1.5b) can be used to produce beams of electrons. At one end of the tube is
a metal wire (cathode), which is heated to a high temperature when a low voltage is applied to it. At
the other end of the tube is a fluorescent screen, which glows when electrons hit it.

Figure 1.5: a The beam of electrons is deflected away from a negatively charged plate and towards a positively
charged plate. b The electron beam in a cathode-ray tube is deflected by an electromagnetic field. The direction of
the deflection shows us that the electron is negatively charged.

The electrons are given off from the heated wire and are attracted towards two metal plates, which are
positively charged. As they pass through the metal plates, the electrons form a beam. When the
electron beam hits the screen a spot of light is produced. When an electric field is applied across this
beam the electrons are deflected. The fact that the electrons are so easily attracted to the positively
charged anode and that they are easily deflected by an electric field shows us that:
electrons have a negative charge
electrons have a very small mass.

Figure 1.6: J. J. Thomson calculated the charge to mass ratio of electrons. He used results from experiments with

electrons in cathode-ray tubes.

In recent years, experiments have been carried out with beams of electrons, protons and neutrons
moving at the same velocity in an electric field.

Figure 1.7: A beam of protons is deflected away from a positively charged area. This shows us that protons have a
positive charge.

The results of these experiments show that:
a proton beam is deflected away from a positively charged plate; as like charges repel, the protons
must have a positive charge (Figure 1.7)
an electron beam is deflected towards a positively charged plate; as opposite charges attract, the
electrons must have a negative charge
a beam of neutrons is not deflected; this shows that they are uncharged.
In these experiments, huge voltages have to be used to deflect the proton beam. This contrasts with
the very low voltages needed to deflect an electron beam. These experiments show us that protons
are much heavier than electrons. If we used the same voltage to deflect electrons and protons, the
beam of electrons would have a far greater deflection than the beam of protons. This is because a
proton is about 2000 times heavier than an electron.

IMPORTANT
Remember that like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other.

Question
1

A beam of electrons is passing close to a highly negatively charged plate. When the electrons pass
close to the plate, they are deflected away from the plate.
a

What deflection would you expect, if any, when the experiment is repeated with beams of i
protons and ii neutrons? Explain your answers.

b

Which subatomic particle (electron, proton or neutron) would deviate the most? Explain your
answer.

Masses and charges: a summary
Electrons, protons and neutrons have characteristic charges and masses. The values of these are too small
to be very useful when discussing general chemical properties. For example, the charge on a single
electron is −1.602 × 10−19 coulombs. We therefore compare their masses and charges by using their
relative charges and masses. These are not the actual charges and masses. They are the charges and
masses compared with each other in a simple ratio. These are shown in Table 1.2.

1.3 Numbers of nucleons
Atomic (proton) number and mass (nucleon) number
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called the atomic number (proton number) (Z). Every
atom of the same element has the same number of protons in its nucleus. It is the atomic number that
makes an atom what it is. For example, an atom with an atomic number of 11 must be an atom of the
element sodium. No other element can have 11 protons in its nucleus. The Periodic Table of elements is
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the individual elements (see Appendix 1).
The mass number (nucleon number) (A) is the number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.

How many neutrons?
We can use the mass number and atomic number to find the number of neutrons in an atom. As:
mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons
Then:
number of neutrons = mass number − atomic number
=A−Z
For example, an atom of aluminium has a mass number of 27 and an atomic number of 13. So an
aluminium atom has 27 − 13 = 14 neutrons.

Isotopes
All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons. However, they may have different
numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons are called
isotopes.
Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different mass numbers.
Isotopes of a particular element have the same chemical properties because they have the same number
of electrons. They have slightly different physical properties, such as small differences in density or small
differences in mass, because they have different numbers of neutrons.
We can write symbols for isotopes. We write the nucleon number at the top left of the chemical symbol and
the proton number at the bottom left.
The symbol for the isotope of boron with 5 protons and 11 nucleons is written 115B:

Hydrogen has three isotopes. The atomic structure and isotopic symbols for the three isotopes of hydrogen
are shown in Figure 1.8.

Figure 1.8: The atomic structure and isotopic symbols for the three isotopes of hydrogen.

When writing generally about isotopes, chemists also name them by leaving out the proton number and
placing the mass number after the name. For example, the isotopes of hydrogen can be called hydrogen-1,
hydrogen-2 and hydrogen-3.
Remember that in writing isotopes, mass number is the figure which is superscript.
Isotopes can be radioactive or non-radioactive. Specific radioisotopes (radioactive isotopes) can be used to
check for leaks in oil or gas pipelines and to check the thickness of paper. They are also used in medicine
to treat some types of cancer and to check the activity of the thyroid gland in the throat.

a

Write isotopic symbols for the following neutral atoms:

b

c

calcium-44

d

e

How many protons, neutrons and electrons?
In a neutral atom the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus equals the number of negatively
charged electrons outside the nucleus. When an atom gains or loses electrons, ions are formed, which are
electrically charged. For example:
Cl
chlorine atom
17 protons
17 electrons

e−
1 electron gained

+

→

Cl−
chloride ion
17 protons
18 electrons

The chloride ion has a single negative charge because there are 17 protons (+) and 18 electrons (−).
Mg
magnesium atom
12 protons
10 electrons

→

Mg2+
magnesium ion

+

2e−
2 electrons
removed

12 protons
10 electrons

The magnesium ion has a charge of 2+ because it has 12 protons (+) but only 10 electrons (−).
2−
The isotopic symbol for an ion derived from sulfur-33 is 33
. This sulfide ion has 16 protons, 17 neutrons
16S
(because 33 − 16 = 17) and 18 electrons (because 16 + 2 = 18).

IMPORTANT

Ions: charged particles formed by the loss or gain of electrons from an atom or group of covalently
bonded atoms. Remember that positive ions are formed when one or more electrons are lost by an
atom and that negative ions are formed when one or more electrons are gained by an atom.

WORKED EXAMPLE
1

2+
Deduce the number of electrons in the ion 52
.
24Cr

Solution
Step 1:

Work out the number of protons. This is the subscripted number 24.

Step 2:

Number of protons = number of electrons in the neutral atom. So number of electrons in
the atom is 24.

Step 3:

For a positive ion subtract the number of charges (because electrons have been lost from
the atom). For a negative ion add the number of charges (because electrons have been
gained).
So for Cr2+, 24 − 2 = 22 electrons.

sure that you can write simple electronic configurations.

5

Ask another learner to select one of the first 20 elements in the Periodic Table. Then ask them to

Compare your answers with those of another learner.

SEEING MORE DETAIL
If we try to study materials using an ordinary microscope with glass lenses, we find that there is a limit
to how much we can magnify something. For example, we cannot see the tiny pores in some types of
polymers (long-chain molecules). If, instead of light, we use a beam of electrons as a source of
illumination, we can increase the magnification of an object up to a million times. This is because the

wavelength of electrons can be 100 000 times shorter than the wavelength of visible light. (The
wavelength is the distance between the crests of two waves). In Section 1.2, we saw how beams of
electrons can be produced by a cathode-ray tube. We use an ‘electron gun’ similar to this to fire a
beam of electrons at a sample. In 1926, Hans Busch developed an electromagnetic lens. Other
scientists encouraged him to develop an electron microscope but it was not until 1931 that Ernst
Ruska and Max Knoll produced the first electron microscope.
In the modern electron transmission microscope, a beam of electrons is accelerated in an electric field
and focused on a specimen by an electromagnetic lens. Some electrons are transmitted through the
specimen, others are absorbed and reflected as various types of radiation. The transmitted and
reflected radiation can be absorbed onto a fluorescent screen to give an image (Figure 2.1).
The electron microscope can be used to calculate the size of pores in polymers and investigate the
surfaces of metals (see Figure 2.2) and other materials. The radiation reflected in a scanning electron
microscope can be used to identify chemical elements.

Figure 2.2: Coloured scanning electron micrograph of metal nanoparticles.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Why must the inside of the electron microscope be at a very low pressure so that there is hardly
any air present?
Why must the specimens studied using an electron microscope have dry surfaces?
Why might it be useful to be able to look at a substance in more detail?

2.1 Simple electronic structure
In Section 1.2 we saw that electrons are arranged outside the nucleus in energy levels or quantum shells.
These principal energy levels or principal quantum shells (symbol n) are numbered according to how far
they are from the nucleus. The lowest energy level, n = 1, is closest to the nucleus, the energy level n = 2
is further out, and so on. The electrons in quantum shells further away from the nucleus have more energy
and are held less tightly to the nucleus.
The arrangement of electrons in an atom is called its electronic structure or electronic configuration.
The electronic configurations of lithium, neon and chlorine are shown in Figure 2.3, together with a
shorthand way of writing this structure.

Figure 2.3: The simple electronic structures of lithium, neon and chlorine. The nuclei of the atoms are not shown.

Table 2.1 shows the number of electrons in each of the principal quantum shells (principal energy levels)
for the first 11 elements in the Periodic Table.
Each principal quantum shell can hold a maximum number of electrons:
shell 1: up to 2 electrons
shell 2: up to 8 electrons
shell 3: up to 18 electrons
shell 4: up to 32 electrons.

2.2 Evidence for electronic structure
Ionisation energy, IE
By firing high-speed electrons at atoms, scientists can work out how much energy has to be supplied to
form an ion by knocking out one electron from each atom.
The energy change that accompanies this process is called the ionisation energy (Figure 2.4).
The first ionisation energy of an element is the energy needed to remove one electron from each atom
in one mole of atoms of the element in the gaseous state to form one mole of gaseous 1+ ions.

Figure 2.4: The frequencies of the lines in an atomic emission spectrum can be used to calculate a value for the
ionisation energy.

IMPORTANT
When writing definitions, look for the key words and try to remember these. In the definition above,
look out for where it says one mole of atoms and one mole of 1+ ions and the gaseous states. One
way of helping you to learn definitions is to write out the definition and circle the important parts.
Ionisation energies are measured under standard conditions. The general symbol for ionisation energy is IE.
Its units are kJ mol−1.
The symbol for the first ionisation energy is IE1. Using calcium as an example:
1st ionisation energy: Ca(g) → Ca+(g) + e−
IE1 = 590 kJ mol−1
If a second electron is removed from each ion in a mole of gaseous 1+ ions, we call it the second ionisation
energy, IE2. Again, using calcium as an example:

2nd ionisation energy: Ca+(g) → Ca2+(g) + e−
IE2 = 1150 kJ mol−1
Removal of a third electron from each ion in a mole of gaseous 2+ ions is called the third ionisation energy.
Again, using calcium as an example:
3rd ionisation energy: Ca2+(g) → Ca3+(g) + e−
IE3 = 4940 kJ mol−1
We can continue to remove electrons from an atom until only the nucleus is left. We call this sequence of
ionisation energies successive ionisation energies.

IMPORTANT
When you write equations for successive ionisation energies, remember that:
the atoms and ions are in the gaseous state
the charge on the ion on the right-hand side gives the number of the ionisation energy (1st, 2nd,
3rd, etc.)

The successive ionisation energies for the first 11 elements in the Periodic Table are shown in Table 2.2.
The data in Table 2.2 shows us that:
For each element, the successive ionisation energies increase. This is because the net positive charge
on the ion gets greater as each electron is removed. As each electron is removed there is a greater
attractive force between the positively charged protons in the nucleus and the remaining negatively
charged electrons. Therefore, more energy is needed to overcome these attractive forces.
There is a big difference between some successive ionisation energies. For nitrogen, this occurs
between the 5th and 6th ionisation energies. For sodium, the first big difference occurs between the
1st and 2nd ionisation energies. These large changes indicate that for the second of these two
ionisation energies the electron is being removed from a principal quantum shell closer to the nucleus.
For example, for the 5th ionisation energy of nitrogen, the electron being removed is from the 2nd principal
quantum shell. For the 6th ionisation energy of nitrogen, the electron being removed is from the 1st
principal quantum shell.

Question
2

a

b

Write equations that describe:
i

the 1st ionisation energy of calcium

ii

the 3rd ionisation energy of potassium

iii

the 2nd ionisation energy of lithium

iv

the 5th ionisation energy of sulfur.

The 2nd ionisation energy of nitrogen is 2860 kJ mol−1. The 3rd ionisation energy of nitrogen is
4580 kJ mol−1. Explain why the 3rd ionisation energy is higher.

Factors that influence ionisation energy
Four factors that influence ionisation energy are:
The size of the nuclear charge: as the atomic number (number of protons) increases, the positive
nuclear charge in the nucleus increases. The bigger the positive charge, the greater the attractive
force between the nucleus and the electrons. So, more energy is needed to overcome these attractive
forces if an electron is to be removed.
In general, ionisation energy increases as the proton number increases.
Distance of outer electrons from the nucleus: the force of attraction between positive and negative
charges decreases rapidly as the distance between them increases. So, electrons in shells further away
from the nucleus are less attracted to the nucleus than those closer to the nucleus.
In general, the further the outer electron shell is from the nucleus, the lower the ionisation energy.
Shielding effect of inner electrons: as all electrons are negatively charged, they repel each other.
Electrons in full inner shells repel electrons in outer shells. Full inner shells of electrons prevent the
outer electrons feeling the full nuclear charge. This is called shielding. The greater the shielding of
outer electrons by the inner electron shells, the lower the attractive forces between the nucleus and
the outer electrons. See Section 2.2 for information on sub-shells and how they affect shielding.
In general, the ionisation energy is lower as the number of full electron shells between the outer
electrons and the nucleus increases.
Spin-pair repulsion: electrons in the same atomic orbital in a sub-shell (see Section 2.3) repel each
other more than electrons in different atomic orbitals. This increased repulsion makes it easier to
remove an electron. So first ionisation energy is decreased.

Interpreting successive ionisation energies
Figure 2.5 shows a graph of successive ionisation energies against the number of electrons removed for
sodium. A logarithmic scale (to the base 10) is used because the values of successive ionisation energies
have such a large range.
We can deduce the following about sodium from Figure 2.5:
The first electron removed has a low first ionisation energy, when compared with the rest of the data.
It is very easily removed from the atom. It is therefore likely to be a long way from the nucleus and
well shielded by inner electron shells.
The second electron is much more difficult to remove than the first electron. There is a big jump in the
value of the ionisation energy. This suggests that the second electron is in a shell closer to the nucleus
than the first electron. Taken together, the 1st and 2nd ionisation energies suggest that sodium has
one electron in its outer shell.
From the second to the ninth electrons removed, there is only a gradual change in successive
ionisation energies. This suggests that all these eight electrons are in the same shell.

Figure 2.5: Graph of logarithm (log10) of the ionisation energy of sodium against the number of electrons removed.

The 10th and 11th electrons have extremely high ionisation energies, when compared with the rest of
the data. This suggests that they are very close to the nucleus. There must be a very great force of
attraction between the nucleus and these electrons and there are no inner electrons to shield them.
The large increase in ionisation energy between the 9th and 10th electrons confirms that the 10th
electron is in a shell closer to the nucleus than the 9th electron.
Figure 2.6 shows this arrangement of electrons.

Figure 2.6: The arrangement of electrons in an atom of sodium can be deduced from the values of successive ionisation
energies.

WORKED EXAMPLE
1

The successive ionisation energies, IE, of an element X are shown in Table 2.3. Which group in the
Periodic Table does X belong to?

Solution
Step 1:

We look for a large jump in the value of the ionisation energy. This occurs between the
removal of the 6th and 7th electrons.

Step 2:

Take the lower number (this represents the number of electrons that are relatively easily
removed). This number is the number of electrons in the outer shell of X. In this case 6.

Step 3:

Relate number of outer shell electrons to the group number. So, element X must be in
Group 16 of the Periodic Table.

We can use successive ionisation energies in this way to:

confirm the number of electrons in the outer shell of an element and hence the group to which the

deduce which group an element belongs to in the Periodic Table.

2.3 Sub-shells and atomic orbitals
Quantum sub-shells
The principal quantum shells, apart from the first, are split into sub-shells (sub-levels). Each principal
quantum shell contains a different number of sub-shells. The sub-shells are distinguished by the letters s, p
or d. There are also f sub-shells for elements with more than 57 electrons. Figure 2.7 shows the sub-shells
for the first four principal quantum levels. In any principal quantum shell, the energy of the electrons in the
sub-shells increases in the order s < p < d.
The first principal quantum level, n = 1, can hold a maximum of 2 electrons in an s sub-shell.
The second principal quantum level, n = 2, can hold a maximum of 8 electrons: 2 electrons in the s
sub-shell and 6 electrons in the p sub-shell.
The third principal quantum level, n = 3, can hold a maximum of 18 electrons: 2 electrons in the s subshell, 6 electrons in the p sub-shell and 10 electrons in the d sub-shell.
You will also notice from Figure 2.7 that the order of the sub-shells in terms of increasing energy does not
follow a regular pattern of s then p then d after the element argon. The order of sub-shells after argon
appears to overlap. The next element after argon is potassium. Potassium’s outer electron is in the 4s, not
in the 3d, sub-shell. The first element with an electron in the 3d sub-shell is element 21, scandium.

Figure 2.7: The sub-shells for the first four principal quantum shells. The maximum number of electrons that are allowed
in each sub-shell is: s = 2 electrons, p = 6 electrons, d = 10 electrons.

When high-speed electrons hit gas particles at low pressure, coloured lines are seen through an instrument
called a spectroscope (see Figure 2.4). The letters s, p and d come from the terms used to describe these
lines: ‘s’ for ‘sharp’, ‘p’ for ‘principal’ and ‘d’ for ‘diffuse’.

Atomic orbitals
Each sub-shell contains one or more atomic orbitals.
An atomic orbital is a region of space around the nucleus of an atom that can be occupied by one or two
electrons.
As each orbital can only hold a maximum of two electrons, the number of orbitals in each sub-shell must
be:

s − one orbital
p − three orbitals
d − five orbitals

Shapes of the orbitals
Each orbital has a three-dimensional shape. Within this shape there is a high probability of finding the
electron or electrons in the orbital. Figure 2.8 shows how we represent the s and p orbitals.
An s orbital has a spherical shape. The 2s orbital in the second principal quantum shell has the same shape
as the 1s orbital in the first quantum shell. They are both spherical, but electrons in the 2s orbital have
more energy than electrons in the 1s orbital. There are three 2p orbitals in the second quantum shell. Each
of these has the same shape. The shape is like an hourglass with two ‘lobes’. The three sets of ‘lobes’ are
arranged at right angles to each other along the x, y and z axes. Hence the three 2p orbitals are named
2px, 2py and 2pz. The three 2p orbitals have the same energy as each other. There are also three 3p
orbitals in the third quantum shell. Their shapes are similar to the shapes of the 2p orbitals but, again, their
energies are higher.

Figure 2.8: Representations of orbitals (the position of the nucleus is shown by the black dot). a s orbitals are spherical. b
p orbitals, px, py and pz, have ‘lobes’ along the x, y and z axes.

Figure 2.9: The shape of a dz2 orbital.

The d orbitals are more complex in shape and arrangement in space. In 1925 Louis de Broglie suggested
that electrons behaved like waves. This led to the idea of electron probability clouds. The electron
probability cloud for one type of d orbital has two pieces: it is like a modified p orbital with a ring around
the middle (Figure 2.9). You will not need to know the d-orbital shapes at AS Level, but you will for A Level
when studying the transition elements (see Chapter 24).

Filling the shells and orbitals
The most stable electronic configuration of an atom is the one that has the lowest amount of energy. The
order in which the sub-shells are filled depends on their relative energy. The sub-shell with the lowest
energy, the 1s, is therefore filled first, followed by those that are successively higher in energy. As we
noted in Figure 2.7, the order of the sub-shells in terms of increasing energy does not follow a regular

pattern of s then p then d after argon, where the 3p sub-shell is full. Figure 2.10 shows the order of filling
the sub-shells.

Figure 2.10: Diagram to show the order in which orbitals are filled up to shell n = 4.

Question

a

Give the three types of orbital present in the third principal quantum shell.

b

State the maximum number of electrons that can be found in each sub-shell of the third quantum
shell.

2.4 Electronic configurations
Representing electronic configurations
Here is a detailed way of writing the electronic configuration of an atom of hydrogen, that includes
information about the number of electrons in each sub-shell.

Helium has two electrons. Both electrons can go into the 1s orbital, as this can hold a maximum of two
electrons. So, the electronic structure of helium is 1s2.
Lithium has three electrons. The 1s orbital can only hold a maximum of two electrons so the third
electron must go into the next highest sub-shell, the 2s. So, the electronic structure of lithium is 1s2
2s1.
Electrons are added one by one for successive elements, filling each sub-shell in order of increasing energy.
You can see the electronic configurations of the first 18 elements in Table 2.5.
A question about this type of detailed notation will often be stated like this: ‘Use 1s2 notation to give the
electronic configuration …’ as in Question 6.

a

The electronic configurations of some of the elements after argon are shown in Table 2.6. In this table, part
of the electronic configuration of each element is represented by [Ar]. This ‘noble gas core’ represents the
electronic configuration of argon: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6. This method is a shorthand way of writing electronic
structures of atoms with many electrons. However, in an exam you should be prepared to write out the full
electronic configuration.
You should note the following:

Electronic configuration of potassium
Potassium has the electronic configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1. The outer electron goes into the 4s subshell rather than the 3d sub-shell because the 4s is below the 3d in terms of its energy.

Filling the 3d sub-shell
After calcium, a new sub-shell becomes occupied. The next electron goes into a 3d sub-shell rather than a
4p sub-shell. So, scandium has the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d1 4s2. This is because electrons occupy
the orbitals with the lowest energy: the 3d sub-shell is just above the 4s sub-shell but below the 4p subshell. This begins a pattern of filling the 3d sub-shell ending with zinc. Zinc has the electronic configuration
[Ar] 3d10 4s2.

Chromium and copper
The electronic configurations of chromium and copper do not follow the expected pattern. Chromium has
the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d5 4s1 (rather than the expected [Ar] 3d4 4s2). Copper has the electronic
configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s1 (rather than the expected [Ar] 3d9 4s2). This is because the 3d54s1 and 3d104s1
electron arrangements are more energetically stable. You will have to learn that these two elements are
exceptions to the pattern.

Orbitals and the Periodic Table
The arrangement of elements in the Periodic Table reflects the electronic structure of the elements. The
Periodic Table can be split into blocks of elements (Figure 2.11).
Elements in Groups 1 and 2 have outer electrons in an s sub-shell. These are therefore together called
the s-block.

Figure 2.11: Some of the blocks of elements in the Periodic Table.

Elements in Groups 13 to 18 (apart from He) have outer electrons in a p sub-shell. These are therefore
together called the p-block.
Elements that add electrons to the d sub-shells are called the d-block elements. Most of these are
transition elements.

C

Filling the orbitals
A useful way of representing electronic configurations is a diagram that places electrons in boxes (Figure
2.12).

Each box represents an atomic orbital.
The boxes (orbitals) can be arranged in order of increasing energy from bottom to top.
An electron is represented by an arrow.

Figure 2.12: The electronic configuration of boron in box form.

The direction of the arrow represents the ‘spin’ of the electron. (We imagine an electron rotating
around its own axis either in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction.)
When there are two electrons in an orbital, the ‘spins’ of the electrons are opposite, so the two arrows
in this box point in opposite directions.
Electrons in the same region of space repel each other because they have the same charge. This is called
spin-pair repulsion. Wherever possible, electrons will occupy separate orbitals in the same sub-shell to
minimise this repulsion, so these electrons have their ‘spin’ in the same direction. Electrons are only paired
when there are no more empty orbitals available within a sub-shell. The spins are then opposite to
minimise repulsion. Figure 2.13 shows the electronic structures of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen to illustrate
these points.

Free radicals
A free radical is a species with one or more unpaired electrons. An example of a free radical is an isolated
chlorine atom, which has the electronic configuration 1s22s22p63s23p5. In the 3p orbitals, two of the
orbitals have paired electrons and the remaining orbital has an unpaired electron. The unpaired electron in
a free radical is shown as a dot ·, e.g. Cl·. Groups of atoms can also be free radicals. For example, the H3C·
radical has a carbon atom with an unpaired electron.

Figure 2.13: When adding electrons to a particular sub-shell, the electrons are only paired when no more empty orbitals
are available.

IMPORTANT
The word species refers to different particles such as atoms, ions, molecules, free radicals or electrons
when we want to write in general terms or about more than one type of particle.

Electronic configuration of ions
Positive ions are formed when electrons are removed from atoms. The sodium ion, Na+ (proton number =
11), has 10 electrons so its electronic configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p6. Note that this is the same as the
electronic configuration of neon, the element with 10 electrons in each atom.
Negative ions are formed when atoms gain electrons. The sulfide ion, S2− (proton number = 16), has 18
electrons. Its electronic configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6, which is the same as argon, the element with
18 electrons in each atom.

Note that, in general, electrons in the outer sub-shell are removed when metal ions form their positive ions.
However, the d-block elements behave slightly differently. Reading across the Periodic Table from
potassium to zinc, the 4s sub-shell fills before the 3d sub-shell. But when atoms of a d-block element lose
electrons to form ions, the 4s electrons are lost first.
For example:
Ti atom: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s2 → Ti2+ ion: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2
Cr atom: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s1 → Cr3+ ion: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3

WORKED EXAMPLE

Solution
Step 1:

Step 3:

For a 3+ ion, we remove three electrons.

• the 2 outer s-electrons are removed first: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s23d6 →
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6

• an outer d-electron is then removed: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6 → 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5

e

2.5 Periodic patterns of atomic and ionic radii
IMPORTANT
Stable metal ions are smaller than metal atoms because the atoms have lost their outer shell
electrons, so the attractive forces between the nucleus and outer electrons is larger. Stable non-metal
ions are larger than metal atoms because the atoms have gained electrons to complete their outer
shells, so the attractive forces between the nucleus and outer electrons is smaller.

Atomic radius
The atomic radius increases down any group. This is because, going down the group, each successive
element has one more shell of electrons which is further from the nucleus. Although there is also an
increasing nuclear charge going down the group, the increased effect of inner shell electrons shielding the
outer shell electrons is more important.
The atomic radius decreases across any period. This is because the number of protons, and therefore the
nuclear charge, increases by one with each successive element. The number of electrons also increases by
one but the extra electron added goes into the same (outer) energy level. This means that the shielding
does not change significantly. The greater attractive force of the increased nuclear charge on the outer
shell electrons pulls them closer to the nucleus.

Ionic radius
The ionic radius increases down any group (for ions with the same charge). In each group the number of
electrons lost or gained by each element in the group is generally the same. For example, Group 2
elements form 2+ ions and atoms of Group 17 elements form ions with a charge of −1. The reason for the
increase in ionic radius is similar to that for the atoms. Going down the group, each successive element has
one more shell of electrons which is further from the nucleus. The increased effect of inner shell electrons
shielding the outer shell electrons is more important than the effect of increased nuclear charge.
Going across a period from Group 1 to Group 14, the ionic radius decreases. This is for similar reasons to
those for decreasing atomic radii across a period. The increasing nuclear charge attracts the electrons in
the outer electron shell closer to the nucleus with increasing atomic number. The shielding is approximately
the same, so has less effect than the increase in nuclear charge. Positively charged ions are smaller than
their original atoms because they have lost their outer shell electrons. The change is generally greater than
that for the atomic radius due to the increase in charge as we go from Groups 1 to 14. Negatively charged
ions in Groups 15 to 18 are larger than their original atoms because each atom will have gained one or
more extra electrons into their outer energy level. From Group 15 to Group 18, the ionic radius decreases.
This is for similar reasons to those for decreasing atomic radii across a period and due to the normal charge
on the ions decreasing.

Question
11 a
b

Explain why the values for the ionic radii for the negative ions in Period 3 are higher than the ionic
radii for the positive ions.
Sketch a graph to show how the ionic radius changes across Period 3.

2.6 Patterns in ionisation energies in the Periodic
Table
Patterns across a period
Figure 2.14 shows how the first ionisation energy, IE1, changes across the first two periods. We can explain
the form of the graph mainly by referring to the factors that influence ionisation energies (see Section 2.2).

IMPORTANT
The variation in the values of first ionisation energy is a periodic property because when plotted
against atomic number it shows a repeating pattern. The same goes for the variation of atomic and
ionic radii (see Chapter 10, Section 10.2).

Figure 2.14: A graph of the first ionisation energies of the elements hydrogen to sodium plotted against atomic number.

1 There is a general increase in IE1 across a period. This applies to Period 1 (hydrogen and helium), Period
2 (lithium to neon) and also to other periods. As you go across a period the nuclear charge increases.
But the electron removed comes from the same shell. The force of attraction between the positive
nucleus and the outer negative electrons increases across the period because:

• the nuclear charge increases
• the distance between the nucleus and the outer electron remains reasonably constant
• the shielding by inner shells remains reasonably constant.
2 There is a rapid decrease in ionisation energy between the last element in one period and the first
element in the next period. The IE1 for lithium is much smaller than the IE1 for helium. Helium has two
electrons. These are in the first quantum shell. But lithium has three electrons. The third electron must
go into the next quantum shell further away from the nucleus. The force of attraction between the
positive nucleus and the outer negative electrons decreases because:

• the distance between the nucleus and the outer electron increases
• the shielding by inner shells increases
• these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.
3 There is a slight decrease in IE1 between beryllium and boron. Although boron has one more proton than
beryllium, there is a slight decrease in IE1 on removal of the outer electron. Beryllium has the electronic
structure 1s2 2s2 and boron has the electronic structure 1s2 2s2 2p1. The fifth electron in boron must be
in the 2p sub-shell, which is slightly further away from the nucleus than the 2s sub-shell. There is less
attraction between the fifth electron in boron and the nucleus because:

• the distance between the nucleus and the outer electron increases slightly

• the shielding by inner shells increases slightly
• these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.
4 There is a slight decrease in IE1 between nitrogen and oxygen. Oxygen has one more proton than
nitrogen and the electron removed is in the same 2p sub-shell. So, you might think that IE1 would
increase. However, the spin-pairing of the electrons plays a part here. If you look back at Figure 2.13,
you will see that the electron removed from the nitrogen is from an orbital that contains an unpaired
electron. The electron removed from the oxygen is from the orbital that contains a pair of electrons. The
extra repulsion between the pair of electrons in this orbital results in less energy being needed to
remove an electron. So, IE1 for oxygen is lower, because of spin-pair repulsion.
These patterns repeat themselves across the third period. However, the presence of the d-block elements
in Period 4 disrupts the pattern, as d-block elements have first ionisation energies that are relatively similar
and fairly high.

Patterns down a group
The first ionisation energy decreases as you go down a group in the Periodic Table. For example, in Group 1
the values of IE1 are:
Li = 519 kJ mol−1
Na = 494 kJ mol−1
K = 418 kJ mol−1
Rb = 403 kJ mol−1
As you go down the group, the outer electron removed is from the same type of orbital but from a
successively higher principal quantum level: 2s for lithium, 3s for sodium and 4s for potassium. Although
the nuclear charge is increasing down the group there is less attraction between the outer electron and the
nucleus because:
the distance between the nucleus and the outer electron increases
the shielding by complete inner shells increases
these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.

SUMMARY
Electron shells can be divided into s, p and d sub-shells which can hold a maximum of 2, 6 and 10 electrons
respectively, and each sub-shell has a specific number of orbitals which can each hold a maximum of two electrons.
The first ionisation energy of an element is the energy needed to remove one electron from each atom in one mole
of atoms of the element in the gaseous state (to form gaseous 1+ ions).
The magnitude (how big the value is) of the ionisation energy depends on four things:
the distance of the electron from the nucleus
the number of positive charges in the nucleus
the degree of shielding of outer electrons by inner electron shells
spin-pair repulsion.
The electronic configuration of the outer shell electrons and the position of an element in the Periodic Table can be
deduced using successive ionisation energy data.

BEFORE YOU START
1

Compound ions have more than one type of atom in them, e.g. a sulfate ion. Write down the names
and give the formulae of as many compound ions as you can. Compare your answers with the rest
of the class.

2

Take turns in challenging another learner to write down the formula of a simple compound by
balancing the charges on the positive and negative ions. Check your answers afterwards using a
textbook or the internet.

3

What is meant by the term diatomic? Make a list of diatomic molecules. When you think your list is
complete, compare it with the list made by others in the class. Were there any molecules that you
forgot about?

4

What do you understand by the chemical terms salt, anhydrous, hydrated and water of
crystallisation?

5

Take turns to challenge a partner to balance simple equations. Your partner looks in a textbook for
an equation, then writes the equation down without the large numbers in front of each element or
compound. You then try to balance the equation. How well did you do? Take turns in doing this until
you are sure that you can balance simple equations.

6

Explain to another learner how you change the units dm3 into cm3 and cm3 into dm3? Does the

form. Take turns to do this until you are sure that you understand the use of standard form.

GETTING OUT THE GOLD!
For thousands of years, people have heated rocks to extract materials. The remains of charcoal kilns

for extracting metals dating back thousands of years have been found in Africa. Recently, chemists
have learnt more about how to get materials from the rocks, from the sea, and from plants.
A lot of gold is present as microscopic particles in the rocks. The gold is obtained by crushing and
grinding the rocks from mines that are open to the air (Figure 3.1). Scientists use a method called froth
flotation to produce a ‘sulfide concentrate’ which contains gold, FeS2, CuFeS2 and SiO2 (sand). This is
heated strongly in a furnace, then treated with a solution of sodium cyanide. This makes the gold into
soluble gold cyanide which is then reacted with zinc to form gold. The impurities remain in solution. A
problem with this method is that the need for strong heating makes it difficult to extract the gold using
sodium cyanide.

Figure 3.1: An open-cast gold mine.

Recently, scientists have used bacteria to extract the gold. Strong heating is not needed. The bacteria
are mixed with the ‘sulfide concentrate’ and water which contains dissolved oxygen. The bacteria
catalyse the oxidation of the sulfides and also help to make the products of this oxidation watersoluble. After oxidation, the pH of the mixture is first adjusted by adding just the right amount of lime,
and then treated with sodium cyanide.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Look at Figure 3.1. What are the problems with mines which are open to the air, in terms of health,
pollution and other factors?
Why is heating the sulfide concentrate in the open air bad for the environment? How can you
reduce these harmful effects?
Suggest why, when extracting materials, it is important to mix the materials in the right amounts?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using bacteria to extract gold compared with the
old method?

3.1 Masses of atoms and molecules
Unified atomic mass unit
Atoms of different elements have different masses. When we perform chemical calculations, we need to
know how heavy one atom is compared with another. The mass of a single atom is so small that it is
impossible to weigh it directly. To overcome this problem, we have to weigh a lot of atoms. We then
compare this mass with the mass of the same number of ‘standard’ atoms. We define atomic mass in
terms of a ‘standard’ atom. We call this standard the unified atomic mass unit. Scientists have defined
unified atomic mass in terms of the isotope of carbon-12.
The formal definition of a unified atomic mass unit is: one twelfth of an unbound neutral atom of the
carbon-12 isotope in its ground state. (Unbound means an isolated carbon atom and the ground state is
the lowest energy state.) The simplified definition, which you can use for exams, is: one twelfth of the mass
of a carbon-12 atom. The symbol for the unit of unified atomic mass is u. You will also see the symbol Da
used (abbreviation for Dalton).
1 unified atomic mass unit = 1 u = 1.66 × 10−27 kg

Relative atomic mass, Ar
The relative atomic mass is the ratio of the average mass of the atoms of an element to the unified atomic
mass unit. The values of the relative atomic mass in the Periodic Table are determined by using the
weighted average mass of the atoms of a particular element. This is because most elements are mixtures
of isotopes. The definition specifies a particular sample because the proportion of different isotopes can
vary slightly according to the location where the element has been extracted. But this difference is usually
so small that for practical purposes we can use the values given in the Periodic Table.

Note that relative atomic mass has no units because it is a ratio and the units cancel.
The exact Ar of hydrogen is 1.0079. This is very close to 1 and most Periodic Tables give the Ar of hydrogen
as 1.0. However, some elements in the Periodic Table have values that are not whole numbers. For
example, the Ar for chlorine is 35.5. This is because chlorine has two main isotopes. In a sample of chlorine,
chlorine-35 makes up about three-quarters of the chlorine atoms and chlorine-37 makes up about a
quarter.

Relative isotopic mass
Isotopes are atoms that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons (see Section
1.3). We represent the mass number (the total number of neutrons plus protons in an atom) by a number
written at the top left-hand corner of the atom’s symbol, e.g. 20Ne, or by a number written after the atom’s
name or symbol, e.g. neon-20 or Ne-20.
We use the term relative isotopic mass for the mass of a particular isotope of an element which has the
Avogadro number of atoms (6.02 × 1023). For example, the relative isotopic mass of carbon-13 is exactly
13.

Masses of compounds
We find the relative molecular mass (Mr) by adding up the relative atomic masses of all the atoms
present in one molecule.
For example, for methane:
formula:
atoms present:

CH4
1 × C; 4 × H

add Ar values:

(1 × Ar[C]) + (4 × Ar[H]) = Mr of methane

= (1 × 12.0) + (4 × 1.0) = 16.0
When calculating relative molecular masses, we use the simplest formula for the compound. For silicon
dioxide, which has a giant covalent structure of silicon and oxygen atoms joined together, the simplest
formula is SiO2. We say that SiO2 is the formula unit of silicon dioxide.

Relative molecular mass, Mr
The relative molecular mass, Mr is the ratio of the weighted average mass of a molecule of a molecular
compound to the unified atomic mass unit. The relative molecular mass has no units.

Relative formula mass
For compounds containing ions we use the term relative formula mass. This is calculated in the same
way as for relative molecular mass. It is also given the same symbol, Mr. For example, for magnesium
hydroxide:
formula:

Mg(OH)2

ions present:

1 × Mg2+; 2 × (OH−)

add Ar values:

(1 × Ar[Mg]) + (2 × (Ar[O] + Ar[H]))

Mr of magnesium hydroxide: = (1 × 24.3) + (2 × (16.0 + 1.0)) = 58.3

3.2 Hydrated and anhydrous compounds
Some compounds can form crystals which have water as part of their structure. This water is called the
water of crystallisation.
A compound containing water of crystallisation is called a hydrated compound, e.g. hydrated
copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4·5H2O
A compound which does not contain water of crystallisation is called an anhydrous compound e.g.
anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4
There can be different degrees of hydration of a compound, e.g. cobalt(II) chloride-6-water CoCl2·6H2O
and cobalt(II) chloride-2-water CoCl2·2H2O
When writing chemical formulae for hydrated compounds, we show water of crystallisation separated
from the main formula by a dot. Note that the number of moles of water of crystallisation is usually a
whole number.
Anhydrous compounds can be converted to hydrated compounds by adding water:
e.g. CuSO4 + 5H2O → CuSO4·5H2O
The reaction can be reversed by heating:
e.g. CuSO4·5H2O → CuSO4 + 5H2O

IMPORTANT
To calculate the relative molecular mass, Mr, of a hydrated salt such as CuSO4·5H2O, you first calculate
the Mr of CuSO4 and 5H2O separately, then add these together.
Note that in some textbooks you will see the formulae for hydrated salts written with the dot at the bottom
e.g. CuSO4·5H2O.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 3.1
Can you reverse the reaction?
SAFETY: Only carry out this activity in the presence of a teacher, after they have explained safety
aspects.
1

Put one spatulaful of hydrated copper(II) sulfate into a boiling tube.

2

Heat the tube strongly. Record your observations.

3

Let the tube cool for a few minutes.

4

Add a few drops of water to the tube. Record your observations.

Explain your observations using the terms anhydrous, hydrated and water of crystallisation.

Question
1

Use the Periodic Table in Appendix 1 to calculate the relative formula masses of the following:
a

calcium chloride, CaCl2

b

copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4

c

ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO4

d

magnesium nitrate-6-water, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O

Tip: for part d you need to calculate the mass of water separately and then add it to the Mr of Mg(NO3)2.

3.3 Accurate relative atomic masses
Mass spectrometry
A mass spectrometer (Figure 3.2) can be used to measure the mass of each isotope present in an element.
It also compares how much of each isotope is present: the relative abundance (relative isotopic
abundance). A simplified diagram of a mass spectrometer is shown in Figure 3.3. You will not be expected
to know the details of how a mass spectrometer works, but it is useful to understand how the results are
obtained.

Figure 3.2: A mass spectrometer is a large and complex instrument.

Figure 3.3: Simplified diagram of a mass spectrometer.

The atoms of the element in the vaporised sample are converted into ions. The stream of ions travels to a
detector after being deflected by a strong magnetic field. As the magnetic field is increased, the ions of
heavier and heavier isotopes move towards the detector. The detector is connected to a computer, which
displays the mass spectrum.
The mass spectrum produced shows the relative abundance (isotopic abundance) on the vertical axis and
the mass to ion charge ratio (m / e) on the horizontal axis. Figure 3.4 shows a typical mass spectrum for a
sample of lead. Table 3.1 shows how the data is interpreted.

Figure 3.4: The mass spectrum of a sample of lead.

For singly positively charged ions, the (m / e) values give the nucleon number of the isotopes detected. In
the case of lead, Table 3.1 shows that 52% of the lead is the isotope with an isotopic mass of 208. The rest
is lead-204 (2%), lead-206 (24%) and lead-207 (22%).

Determination of Ar from mass spectra
IMPORTANT
You do not need to know the exact working of the mass spectrometer.
We can use the data obtained from a mass spectrometer to calculate the relative atomic mass of an
element very accurately. To calculate the relative atomic mass, we follow this method:
multiply each isotopic mass by its percentage abundance
add the figures together
divide by 100.
We can use this method to calculate the relative atomic mass of neon from its mass spectrum, shown in
Figure 3.5.

Figure 3.5: The mass spectrum of neon, Ne.

The mass spectrum of neon has three peaks: 20Ne (90.9%), 21Ne (0.3%) and 22Ne (8.8%).
Ar of neon =

= 20.2

Note that this answer is given to 3 significant figures, which is consistent with the data given.
A high-resolution mass spectrometer can give very accurate relative isotopic masses. For example, 16O =
15.995 and 32S = 31.972. Because of this high level of precision, chemists can distinguish between
molecules such as SO2 and S2, which appear to have the same relative molecular mass.

Question

Look at the mass spectrum of germanium, Ge.
a

Write isotopic formula for the heaviest isotope of germanium.

b

Use the % abundance of each isotope to calculate the relative atomic mass of germanium.

Identification of an organic compound using mass spectrometry
The main use of mass spectrometry is in the identification of organic compounds. As in other forms of
spectroscopy, a substance can be identified by matching its spectrum against the spectra of known
substances stored in a database. This technique is known as ‘fingerprinting’.
The high energy electrons knock electrons from the molecules and break covalent bonds, fragmenting the
molecule. Figure 3.6 shows the mass spectrum produced by propanone, CH3COCH3.

Figure 3.6: The mass spectrum of propanone, CH3COCH3.

Figure 3.7: The mass spectrum of germanium, Ge.

IMPORTANT
A molecular ion, M+, is formed when one electron is removed from a molecule to form an ion with a
single positive charge e.g. CH4 → CH4+ + e−. Remember that no atoms are removed.
The peak at the highest mass-to-charge ratio is caused by the molecular ion (M+). This ion is formed by
the sample molecule with one electron knocked out. It gives us the relative molecular mass of the sample.
We can assume the ions detected carry a single positive charge, so the reading on the horizontal axis gives
us the mass. In the case of propanone, CH3COCH3, the molecular ion has a relative mass of 58.0. This
corresponds to CH3COCH3+, with a mass of (3 × 12.0) + (1 × 16.0) + (6 × 1.0).
We also get large peaks at 15 and 43 on the mass spectrum. These peaks are due to fragments that are
produced when propanone molecules are broken apart by the electron bombardment. Knowing the
structure of propanone, we should be able to identify the fragment responsible for each peak (Figure 3.8).

Figure 3.8: The fragmentation of propanone: +CH3 causes the peak at 15 and CH3CO+ causes the peak at 43.

IMPORTANT
Remember that fragmentation (breaking apart) of a compound in a mass spectrometer causes certain
bonds to break. You can deduce what the fragment is by adding up the atomic masses of carbon,
hydrogen and / or other atoms. So a fragment of m/e 15 is C + 3H = 12 + (3 × 1) which is +CH3 and a
fragment of m/e 43 could be +C3H7 or CH3CO+.
The electron bombardment has caused the C─C single bonds in the propanone molecules to break. This has
resulted in the fragments at m/e 15 and 43 that are observed in Figure 3.6. The breaking of single bonds,
such as C─C, C─O or C─N, is the most common cause of fragmentation.

IMPORTANT
These fragments are very common in mass spectra of organic compounds.

High-resolution mass spectra
High-resolution mass spectrometers can distinguish between ions that appear to have the same mass on a
low-resolution mass spectrum. Table 3.3 shows the accurate relative isotopic masses of the most common
atoms found in organic molecules.

Table 3.3: Accurate masses of isotopes.

These accurate isotopic masses allow us to measure the mass of the molecular ion so accurately that it can
only correspond to one possible molecular formula. For example, a molecular ion peak at 45 could be

caused by C2H7N or CH3NO. However, a high-resolution mass spectrum would show the C2H7N+ peak at
45.057846 and the CH3NO+ peak at 45.021462. We can, therefore, be sure which molecule is being
analysed.

Using the [M + 1] peak
There will always be a very small peak just beyond the molecular ion peak at a mass of [M + 1]. This is
caused by molecules in which one of the carbon atoms is the 13C isotope. This is shown in the mass
spectrum of ethanol in Figure 3.10.

Figure 3.10: The mass spectrum of ethanol, showing the [M + 1] peak.

In any organic compound there will be 1.10% carbon-13. We can use this fact to work out the number of
carbon atoms (n) in a molecule. We apply the equation:

WORKED EXAMPLE
1

An unknown compound has a molecular ion peak, M+, with a relative abundance of 54.5% and has
an [M + 1]+ peak with a relative abundance of 3.6%. How many carbon atoms does the unknown
compound contain?

Solution
Substituting the values of relative abundance into the equation:

we get:
n=

×

= 6.0

There are 6 carbon atoms in each molecule.

Question
4

A hydrocarbon has a molecular ion peak at a mass-to-charge ratio of 84 (relative abundance of 62.0%)
and an [M + 1] peak with a relative abundance of 4.1%.
How many carbon atoms are in the hydrocarbon?

Using [M + 2] and [M + 4] peaks
Note: Material relating to [M + 4] peaks is extension content. It is not part of the syllabus.

IMPORTANT

We can tell whether there is chlorine or bromine in an organic compound by comparing the relative
heights of the M and [M + 2] peaks. If the peak heights are equal, there is one atom of bromine per
molecule. If the peak heights are in the ratio 3 [M] to 1 [M + 2], there is one atom of chlorine per
molecule.
If the sample compound contains chlorine or bromine atoms, we also get peaks beyond the molecular ion
peak because of isotopes of chlorine and bromine. Chlorine has two isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, as does
bromine, 79Br and 81Br. Table 3.4 shows the approximate percentage of each isotope in naturally occurring
samples.

Table 3.4: Naturally occurring isotopes of chlorine and bromine.

One Cl or Br atom per molecule
Imagine a sample of chloromethane, CH3Cl. We will have molecules of CH335Cl (75%) and molecules of
CH337Cl (25%). The molecular ion will be CH335Cl+, and two units beyond that on the mass spectrum will be
the peak for CH337Cl+. The peak for CH337Cl+ will be one-third the height of the molecular ion. This is the
[M + 2] peak.
In the mass spectrum of bromomethane, CH3Br, we will have two molecular ion peaks of approximately the
same height: one for CH379Br+ and the other for CH381Br+ (the [M + 2] peak).
You should look out for the relative heights mentioned here when interpreting mass spectra.
If the [M + 2] peak is one-third the height of the M peak, this suggests the presence of one chlorine
atom per molecule.
If the [M + 2] peak is the same as the height of the M peak, this suggests the presence of one bromine
atom per molecule.
An example of the [M + 2] peak is shown on the mass spectrum of chlorobenzene (Figure 3.11).

Two Cl or Br atoms per molecule
The situation is a little more complex with two chlorine atoms in a molecule, as there are three possibilities.
Considering dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, we have:
35ClCH 35Cl+
2

the M peak

35ClCH 37Cl+
2

the [M + 2] peak

37ClCH 35Cl+
2

the [M + 2] peak

37

the [M + 4] peak

ClCH237Cl+

The relative heights of the peaks must take into account the natural abundances: it works out as 9 : 6 : 1
for molecules with two Cl atoms.

Figure 3.11: The mass spectrum of chlorobenzene, showing the [M + 2] peak. (Note that there are also tiny [M + 1] and
[M + 3] peaks corresponding to 13C in the molecule.)

The M, [M + 2] and [M + 4] peaks also occur in dibromomethane but the relative heights of peaks are
easier to work out. Because the ratio 79Br : 81Br is 1 : 1, the M : [M + 2] : [M + 4] height ratio is 1 : 2 : 1.

Question
Note: Question 5 contains extension content as [M + 4] peaks are not included in the syllabus.

c

How many peaks would you see beyond the molecular ion peak in 1,1-dibromoethane? What
would be their mass-to-charge ratios and abundances relative to the molecular ion? (Ignore peaks
due to 13C.)

3.4 Amount of substance
The mole and the Avogadro constant
The formula of a compound shows us the number of atoms of each element present in one formula unit or
one molecule of the compound. We know that two atoms of hydrogen (Ar = 1.0) combine with one atom of
oxygen (Ar = 16.0) in water, so the ratio of mass of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms in a water molecule
is 2 : 16. No matter how many molecules of water we have, this ratio will always be the same. But the
mass of even 1000 atoms is far too small to be weighed. We have to scale up much more than this to get
an amount of substance that is easy to weigh.
The number of particles equivalent to the relative atomic mass or relative molecular mass of a substance
in grams is called the Avogadro constant (or Avogadro number). The symbol for the Avogadro constant is L
(the symbol NA may also be used).The numerical value of the Avogadro constant is 6.02 × 1023. The mass
of substance with this number of particles is called a mole. The Avogadro constant is chosen so that the
mass of one mole in grams equals the average mass of an atom of an element in unified atomic mass
units. So a mole of sodium (Ar = 23.0) contains 6.02 × 1023 atoms and has a mass of 23.0 g. The
abbreviation for a mole is mol.
We can define the mole in terms of the Avogadro constant: A mole is the amount of substance which
contains 6.02 × 1023 specified particles. The particles can be atoms, molecules, ions or electrons.

IMPORTANT
In many books you will see an alternative definition of the mole based on the carbon-12 isotope: one
mole of a substance is the amount of that substance that has the same number of specific particles
(atoms, molecules or ions) as there are atoms in exactly 12 g of the carbon-12 isotope. This definition
is now out of date.
The Avogadro constant applies to atoms, molecules, ions and electrons. So in 1 mole of sodium there are
6.02 × 1023 sodium atoms and in 1 mole of sodium chloride (NaCl) there are 6.02 × 1023 sodium ions and
6.02 × 1023 chloride ions.
It is important to make clear what type of particles we are referring to. If we just state ‘moles of chlorine’, it
is not clear whether we are thinking about chlorine atoms or chlorine molecules. A mole of chlorine
molecules, Cl2, contains 6.02 × 1023 chlorine molecules but twice as many chlorine atoms, as there are two
chlorine atoms in every chlorine molecule.

IMPORTANT
Molar mass is a general term used for the mass in grams of 1 mole of a compound, whether ionic,
simple molecules or giant covalent structures. ‘Relative molecular mass’ refers only to molecules.

Figure 3.12: Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856) was an Italian scientist, who first deduced that equal volumes of gases
contain equal numbers of molecules. Although the Avogadro constant is named after him, it was left to other scientists to
calculate the number of particles in a mole.

We often refer to the mass of a mole of substance as its molar mass (abbreviation M). The units of molar
mass are g mol−1.

Moles and mass
The Système International (SI) base unit for mass is the kilogram. But this is a rather large mass to use for
general laboratory work in chemistry, so chemists prefer to use the relative molecular mass or formula
mass in grams (1000 g = 1 kg). You can find the number of moles of a substance by using the mass of
substance and mass of one mole of that substance (the molar mass)
number of moles (mol) =

IMPORTANT
Some students find it helpful to use a triangle such as that shown to work out mass from molar mass
and number of moles. By covering the quantity you want to find, you will see the correct form of the
equation to use.

Figure 3.13: Triangle diagram for mole calculations.

However, it is far better to learn how to cross multiply because such triangles will not work with more
complex equations: ask another learner or a teacher to help you.

WORKED EXAMPLES
2

How many moles of sodium chloride are present in 117.0 g of sodium chloride, NaCl?

(Ar values: Na = 23.0, Cl = 35.5)

Solution
Step 1:

molar mass of NaCl = 23.0 + 35.5
= 58.5 g mol−1

Step 2:

number of moles =
= 2.0 mol

3

What mass of sodium hydroxide, NaOH, is present in 0.25 mol of sodium hydroxide?
(Ar values: H = 1.0, Na = 23.0, O = 16.0)

Solution
Step 1:

molar mass of NaOH = 23.0 + 16.0
+ 1.0 = 40.0 g mol−1

Step 2:

mass = number of moles × molar mass
= 0.25 × 40.0 g = 10.0 g NaOH

IMPORTANT
When dealing with moles, it is important to be clear about the type of particle referred to. For example:
32.0 grams of oxygen O2 contains 1 mole of oxygen molecules but 2 moles of oxygen atoms and 1
mole of MgCl2 contains 1 mol of Mg2+ ions but 2 moles of Cl− ions.

Question

b

Use these Ar values (Fe = 55.8, N = 14.0, O = 16.0, S = 32.1) to calculate the amount of
substance in moles in each of the following:
i

10.7 g of sulfur atoms

ii

64.2 g of sulfur molecules (S8)

iii

60.45 g of anhydrous iron(III) nitrate, Fe(NO3)3

Use the value of the Avogadro constant (6.02 × 1023 mol−1) to calculate the total number of
atoms in 7.10 g of chlorine atoms. (Ar value: Cl = 35.5)

To find the mass of a substance present in a given number of moles, you need to rearrange the equation
number of moles (mol) =
mass of substance (g) = number of moles (mol) × molar mass (g mol−1)
Figure 3.14 shows what the molar mass of six elements looks like.

3.5 Mole calculations
Reacting masses
When reacting chemicals together, we may need to know what mass of each reactant to use so that they
react exactly and there is no waste (Figure 3.15). To calculate this, we need to know the chemical equation.
This shows us the ratio of moles of the reactants and products: the stoichiometry of the equation. The
balanced equation shows this stoichiometry. For example, in the reaction
Fe2O3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO2
1 mole of iron(III) oxide reacts with 3 moles of carbon monoxide to form 2 moles of iron and 3 moles of
carbon dioxide. The stoichiometry of the equation is 1 : 3 : 2 : 3. The large numbers that are included in the
equation (3, 2 and 3) are called stoichiometric numbers.
In order to find the mass of products formed in a chemical reaction we use:
the mass of the reactants
the molar mass of the reactants
the balanced equation.

Figure 3.15: Iron reacting with sulfur to produce iron sulfide. We can calculate exactly how much iron is needed to react
with sulfur and the mass of the products formed by knowing the molar mass of each reactant and the balanced chemical
equation.

WORKED EXAMPLE
4

Magnesium burns in oxygen to form magnesium oxide.
2Mg + O2 → 2MgO
Calculate the mass of oxygen needed to react with 1 mole of magnesium. What is the mass of the
magnesium oxide formed?.

Solution
Step 1:

Write the balanced equation.
2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

Step 2:

Multiply each formula mass in g by the relevant stoichiometric number in the equation.

2 × 24.3 g

1 × 32.0 g

48.6 g

32.0 g

2 × (24.3 g + 16.0 g)
80.6 g

From this calculation we can deduce that:
32.0 g of oxygen are needed to react exactly with
48.6 g of magnesium

80.6 g of magnesium oxide are formed.
If we burn 12.15 g of magnesium (0.5 mol) we get 20.15 g of magnesium oxide. This is because the
stoichiometry of the reaction shows us that for each mole (or part of mole) of magnesium burnt, we
get the same number of moles of magnesium oxide. This means that for every 0.5 mole burnt, we
get 0.5 mole of product.

In this type of calculation we do not always need to know the molar mass of each of the reactants. If one or
more of the reactants is in excess, we need only know the mass in grams and the molar mass of the
reactant that is not in excess.
The reactant which has the number of moles in excess is called the excess reagent.
The reactant which is not in excess is called the limiting reagent.

IMPORTANT
Remember that in calculating which reactant is limiting, you must:
work out the number of moles of the reactant
take into account the ratio of the reactants shown in the equation (the stoichiometry).

WORKED EXAMPLE
5

A sample of 79.8 g of iron(III) oxide is mixed with 9.36 g of carbon and heated. A reaction occurs.
2Fe2O3 + 3C → 4Fe + 3CO2
Show by calculation that iron(III) oxide is the limiting reactant.
(Ar values: Fe = 55.8, O = 16.0, C = 12.0)

Solution
Step 1:

Calculate the moles of each reagent.
moles of Fe2O3 =
moles of C =

Step 2:

= 0.50 mol
= 0.78 mol

Refer to the stoichiometry of the equation:
For every 2 Fe2O3 which react, 3 C are needed
So for 0.5 mol Fe2O3 we need 0.5 ×

Step 3:

= 0.75 mol C

Determine which is in excess.
number of moles C required = 0.75 number of moles C from step 1 = 0.78
So C is in excess by 0.78 − 0.75 = 0.03 mol and iron(III) oxide is limiting.

WORKED EXAMPLE
6

Iron(III) oxide reacts with carbon monoxide to form iron and carbon dioxide.
Fe2O3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO2
Calculate the maximum mass of iron produced when 798 g of iron(III) oxide is reduced by excess
carbon monoxide. (Ar values: Fe = 55.8, O = 16.0)

Solution
Step 1:

Write the balanced equation.

Fe2O3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO2
Step 2:

Step 3:

Calculate molar masses taking into account the number of moles in the equation.
1 mole iron(III) oxide

→

2 moles iron

(2 × 55.8) + (3 × 16.0)

→

2 × 55.8

159.6 g Fe2O3

→

111.6 g Fe

Calculate mass of Fe in 798 g Fe2O3

× 798 = 558 g Fe

You can see that in step 3, we have simply used ratios to calculate the amount of iron produced from
798 g of iron(III) oxide.

Question
8

a

Sodium reacts with excess oxygen to form sodium peroxide, Na2O2.
2Na + O2 → Na2O2
Calculate the maximum mass of sodium peroxide formed when 4.60 g of sodium is burnt in
excess oxygen. (Ar values: Na = 23.0, O = 16.0)

b

Tin(IV) oxide is reduced to tin by carbon. Carbon monoxide is also formed.
SnO2 + 2C → Sn + 2CO
Calculate the mass of carbon that exactly reacts with 14.0 g of tin(IV) oxide. Give your answer to
3 significant figures. (Ar values: C = 12.0, O = 16.0, Sn = 118.7)

The stoichiometry of a reaction
We can find the stoichiometry of a reaction if we know the amounts of each reactant that exactly react
together and the amounts of each product formed.
For example, if we react 4.0 g of hydrogen with 32.0 g of oxygen we get 36.0 g of water. (Ar values: H =
1.0, O = 16.0)

This ratio is the ratio of stoichiometric numbers in the equation. So the equation is:
2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
We can still deduce the stoichiometry of this reaction even if we do not know the mass of oxygen that
reacted. The ratio of hydrogen to water is 1 : 1. But there is only one atom of oxygen in a molecule of
water: half the amount in an oxygen molecule. So the mole ratio of oxygen to water in the equation must
be 1 : 2.

Question
9

56.2 g of silicon, Si, reacts exactly with 284.0 g of chlorine, Cl2, to form 340.2 g of silicon(IV) chloride,
SiCl4. Use this information to calculate the stoichiometry of the reaction.
(Ar values: Cl = 35.5, Si = 28.1)

Significant figures
When we perform chemical calculations it is important that we give the answer to the number of significant

figures that fits with the data provided. The examples here show the number 526.84 rounded up to varying
numbers of significant figures.
rounded to 4 significant figures = 526.8
rounded to 3 significant figures = 527
rounded to 2 significant figures = 530

IMPORTANT
When you are writing an answer to a calculation, the answer should be to the same number of
significant figures as the least number of significant figures in the data.
Do not round numbers to the correct number of significant figures until the end of a calculation or you
risk introducing errors.

Percentage composition by mass
We can use the formula of a compound and relative atomic masses to calculate the percentage by mass of
a particular element in a compound.

WORKED EXAMPLES
7

How many moles of calcium oxide are there in 2.9 g of calcium oxide?
(Ar values: Ca = 40.1, O = 16.0)

Solution
If you divide 2.9 by 56.1, your calculator shows 0.051 693 … The least number of significant figures
in the data, however, is 2 (the mass is 2.9 g). So your answer should be expressed to 2 significant
figures, as 0.052 mol.

Note:

8

1

Zeros before a number are not significant figures. For example, 0.004 is only to 1 significant
figure.

2

After the decimal point, zeros after a number are significant figures. 0.0040 has 2 significant
figures and 0.004 00 has 3 significant figures.

If you are performing a calculation with several steps, do not round up in between steps. Round
up at the end.

using molar masses.

Question
10 Calculate the percentage by mass of carbon in ethanol, C2H5OH.
(Ar values: C = 12.0, H = 1.0, O = 16.0)

Percentage yield
In many chemical reactions, especially organic reactions, not all the reactants are changed to the products
you want. This is because there are other reactions going on at the same time; reactants or products are
lost to the atmosphere; or the reaction does not go to completion. The percentage yield tells you how much
of a particular product you get from the reactants compared with the maximum theoretical amount that
you can get.
percentage yield =

× 100

The actual yield is the moles or mass of product obtained by experiment.
The predicted yield is the moles or mass of product obtained by calculation if no side products are formed
and all of a specific reactant is converted to a specific product.

A sample of aluminium chloride, AlCl3, is made by reacting 18 g of aluminium powder with excess
chlorine. The mass of aluminium chloride produced is 71.0 g. Calculate the percentage yield of
aluminium oxide. (Ar values: Al = 27.0, Cl = 35.5)
2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3

Solution
Step 1:

Calculate the predicted mass from the stoichiometry of the equation if all the
aluminium is converted to aluminium chloride.
2 × 27 g Al produces
2 × (27 + (3 × 35.5)) g AlCl3
54 g Al produces 267 g AlCl3

Step 2:

Calculate the mass of aluminium chloride formed from the given amount of aluminium
using simple proportion.
18 g Al produces 267 ×

Step 3:

= 89.0 g AlCl3

Calculate the percentage yield.
× 100 = 79.8%

Empirical formulae
The empirical formula of a compound is the simplest whole number ratio of the elements present in one
molecule or formula unit of the compound. The molecular formula of a compound shows the number of
atoms of each element present in a molecule.
Table 3.5 shows the empirical and molecular formulae for a number of compounds.
The formula for an ionic compound is always its empirical formula.
The empirical formula and molecular formula for simple inorganic molecules are often the same.
Organic molecules often have different empirical and molecular formulae.

formula of this hydrocarbon.
(Ar values: C = 12.0, H = 1.0)

Molecular formulae
The molecular formula shows the actual number of each of the different atoms present in a molecule. We
use the molecular formula to write balanced equations and to calculate molar masses. The molecular
formula is always a multiple of the empirical formula. For example, the molecular formula of ethane, C2H6,
is twice the empirical formula, CH3.

In order to deduce the molecular formula we need to know:
the relative formula mass of the compound
the empirical formula.

WORKED EXAMPLE
13 A compound has the empirical formula CH2Br. Its relative molecular mass is 187.8. Deduce the
molecular formula of this compound.

Solution
Step 1:
Step 2:
Step 3:

Find the empirical formula mass: 12.0 + (2 × 1.0) + 79.9 = 93.9

Multiply the number of atoms in the empirical formula by the number in step 2:
2 × CH2Br, so molecular formula is C2H4Br2.

3.6 Chemical formulae and chemical equations
Deducing the formula for ionic and covalent compounds
Ionic compounds
The electronic structure of the individual elements in a compound determines the formula of a compound
(see Section 2.1). The formula of an ionic compound is determined by the charges on each of the ions
present. The number of positive charges is balanced by the number of negative charges so that the total
charge on the compound is zero. We can work out the formula for a compound if we know the charges on
the ions. Figure 3.17 shows the charges on some ions related to the position of the elements in the Periodic
Table. The form of the Periodic Table that we shall be using has 18 groups because the transition elements
are numbered as Groups 3 to 12. So, aluminium is in Group 13 and chlorine is in Group 17.
For simple metal ions in Groups 1 and 2, the value of the positive charge is the same as the group number.
For a simple metal ion in Group 13, the value of the positive charge is 3+. For a simple non-metal ion in
Groups 15 to 17, the value of the negative charge is 18 minus the group number. The charge on the ions of
transition elements can vary. For example, iron forms two types of ions, Fe2+ and Fe3+ (Figure 3.18).

Figure 3.17: The charge on some simple ions is related to their position in the Periodic Table.

Figure 3.18: Iron(II) chloride (left) and iron(III) chloride (right). These two chlorides of iron both contain iron and chlorine,
but they have different formulae.

The roman numerals after the ions are called oxidation numbers.
There are rules for deducing oxidation numbers (see Section 7.2):
For most metal ions in Groups 1 to 3, the oxidation numbers are equal to the positive charge on the
ion, e.g. an Al3+ ion has an oxidation number of +3. When naming compounds containing these ions,
we do not include the oxidation number of the positive ion, e.g. magnesium oxide (not magnesium(II)
oxide).
Simple negative ions have oxidation numbers which are the same as the charge on the ion, e.g. O2−
has an oxidation number of −2 and Cl− has an oxidation number of −1. When naming compounds
containing these ions we do not include the oxidation number of the negative ion as these do not
generally vary.
For transition elements, the oxidation numbers do vary. They show the charge on the ion, e.g.
chromium(II) chloride contains a Cr2+ ion and chromium(III) chloride contains a Cr3+ ion. When naming

these compounds we must include the oxidation number to avoid confusion.
Ions that contain more than one type of atom are called compound ions. Some common compound ions
and two metal ions that you should learn are listed in Table 3.8. The formula for an ionic compound is
obtained by balancing the charges of the ions.

Table 3.8: The formulae of some common ions.

WORKED EXAMPLES
14 Deduce the formula of magnesium chloride.

Solution
Ions present: Mg2+ and Cl−.
For electrical neutrality, we need two Cl− ions for every Mg 2+ ion.
(2 × 1−) + (1 × 2+) = 0
So the formula is MgCl2.
15 Deduce the formula of aluminium oxide.
Ions present: Al3+ and O2−.
For electrical neutrality, we need three O2− ions for every two Al3+ ions.
(3 × 2−) + (2 × 3+) = 0
So the formula is Al2O3.

Covalent compounds
You can work out the formula of a covalent compound from the number of electrons needed to achieve the
stable electronic configuration of a noble gas (see Section 4.1). In general, carbon atoms form four bonds
with other atoms, hydrogen and halogen atoms form one bond and oxygen atoms form two bonds. So the
formula of water, H2O, follows these rules. The formula for methane is CH4, with each carbon atom bonding
with four hydrogen atoms. However, there are many exceptions to these rules.
Compounds containing a simple metal ion and non-metal ion are named by changing the end of the name
of the non-metal element to ‘-ide’.
sodium + chlorine → sodium chloride
zinc + sulfur → zinc sulfide
The names of compound ions containing oxygen often end in ‘-ate’. Sometimes they end in ‘-ite’. For
example, the sulfate ion contains sulfur and four oxygen atoms, the phosphate ion contains phosphorus
and oxygen.

Balancing chemical equations
When chemicals react, atoms cannot be either created or destroyed. So there must be the same number of
each type of atom on the reactants side of a chemical equation as there are on the products side. A symbol
equation is a shorthand way of describing a chemical reaction. It shows the number and type of the atoms
in the reactants and the number and type of atoms in the products. If this number of each type of atom is
the same on both sides, we say the equation is balanced. Follow these examples to see how we balance an
equation.

IMPORTANT
When balancing chemical equations remember:
Do not change any of the formulae.
The numbers used to balance are put in front of the formulae.
In equations involving combustion reactions of organic compounds, balance the carbon first and
then the hydrogen. Balance the oxygen last.

WORKED EXAMPLES
16 Write a balanced equation for the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water.

Solution
Step 1:

Write down the formulae of all the reactants and products. For example:
H 2 + O 2 → H 2O

Step 2:

Step 3:

Count the number of atoms of each reactant and product.
H2

+ O2 →

2[H]

2[O]

H 2O
2[H] + 1[O]

Balance one of the atoms by placing a number in front of one of the reactants or
products. In this case the oxygen atoms on the right-hand side need to be balanced, so
that they are equal in number to those on the left-hand side. Remember that the
number in front multiplies everything in the formula. For example, 2H2O has 4 hydrogen
atoms and 2 oxygen atoms.
H2

+ O2 → 2H2O

2[H]
Step 4:

2[O]

4[H] + 2[O]

Keep balancing in this way, one type of atom at a time until all the atoms are balanced.
2H2

+ O2 → 2H2O

4[H]

2[O]

4[H] + 2[O]

Note that when you balance an equation you must not change the formulae of any of the reactants
or products.
17 Write a balanced equation for the reaction of iron(III) oxide with carbon monoxide to form iron and
carbon dioxide.

Step 1:

In step 4, the oxygen in the CO2 comes from two places, the Fe2O3 and the CO. Note that trial and
error is involved here as the carbon also needs to be balanced.
In this particular case, in order to balance the equation, three oxygen atoms come from the iron
oxide and three oxygen atoms come from the carbon monoxide.

IMPORTANT
When balancing chemical equations follow these steps:
Write the formulae of the reactants and products
Count the numbers of atoms in each reactant and product
Balance the atoms one at a time until all the atoms are balanced.

Question
15 Write balanced equations for the following reactions.
a

Iron reacts with hydrochloric acid to form iron(II) chloride, FeCl2, and hydrogen.

b

Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3, breaks down on heating to form aluminium oxide, Al2O3, and
water.

c

Hexane, C6H14, burns in oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.

Using state symbols
We sometimes find it useful to specify the physical states of the reactants and products in a chemical
reaction. This is especially important where chemical equilibria and rates of reaction are being discussed
(see Chapter 8 and Chapter 9). We use the following state symbols:
(s) solid
(l) liquid
(g) gas
(aq) aqueous (a solution in water).
State symbols are written after the formula of each reactant and product. For example:
ZnCO3(s) + H2SO4(aq) → ZnSO4(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)

Question
16 Write balanced equations, including state symbols, for the following reactions.
a

Solid calcium carbonate reacts with aqueous hydrochloric acid to form water, carbon dioxide and
an aqueous solution of calcium chloride.

b

An aqueous solution of zinc sulfate, ZnSO4, reacts with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.

The products are a precipitate of zinc hydroxide, Zn(OH)2, and an aqueous solution of sodium sulfate.

Figure 3.19: The reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid.

The equation for the reaction shown in Figure 3.19, with all the state symbols, is:
CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl2(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Question
17 Which is the correct equation for the reaction between iron(III) oxide and carbon monoxide?
A

Fe2O3(g)

+ 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3CO2(l)

B

2FeO(s)

+ 2CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 2CO2(l)

C

Fe2O3(g)

+ 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3CO2(g)

D

2Fe2O3(g) + 3CO(g) → 4Fe(s) + 3CO2(g)

Balancing ionic equations
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions separate from each other. For example:
NaCl(s) + aq → Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
Ionic compounds include salts such as sodium bromide, magnesium sulfate and ammonium nitrate. Acids
and alkalis also contain ions. For example, H+(aq) and Cl−(aq) ions are present in hydrochloric acid and Na+
(aq) and OH−(aq) ions are present in sodium hydroxide.
Many chemical reactions in aqueous solution involve ionic compounds. Only some of the ions in solution
take part in these reactions.
The ions that play no part in the reaction are called spectator ions.
An ionic equation is simpler than a full chemical equation. It shows only the ions or other particles taking
part in a reaction. Spectator ions are omitted (left out). Ionic equations are often written for reactions
involving a change in oxidation state. Compare the full equation for the reaction of zinc with aqueous
copper(II) sulfate with the ionic equation.
full chemical equation:
Zn(s) + CuSO4(aq) → ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)
with charges:
Zn(s) + Cu2+SO42−(aq) → Zn2+SO42−(aq) + Cu(s)
cancelling spectator ions:
Zn(s) + Cu2+

→ Zn2+

+ Cu(s)

ionic equation:
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
In the ionic equation you will notice that:
there are no sulfate ions: these are the spectator ions as they have not changed
both the charges and the atoms are balanced.

IMPORTANT
When writing an ionic equation remember:
The product(s) will often include a precipitate or simple molecules such as iodine or water e.g.
Cl2(aq) + 2I−(aq) → I2(aq) + 2Cl−(aq)
Acids are represented by H+ ions, e.g. ZnO(s) + 2H+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + H2O(l)

The next examples show how we can change a full equation into an ionic equation.

WORKED EXAMPLE
18 Writing an ionic equation:

Solution
Step 1:

Write down the full balanced equation.
Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)

Step 2:

Write down all the ions present. Any reactant or product that has a state symbol (s), (l)
or (g) or is a covalent molecule in solution such as chlorine, Cl2(aq), does not split into
ions.
Mg(s) + 2H+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) →
Mg2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + H2(g)

Step 3:

Cancel the ions that appear on both sides of the equation (the spectator ions).
Mg(s) + 2H+(aq) +

→

Mg2+(aq) +
Step 4:

+ H2(g)

Write down the equation omitting the spectator ions.
Mg(s) + 2H+(aq) → Mg2+(aq) + H2(g)

19 Write the ionic equation for the reaction of aqueous chlorine with aqueous potassium bromide. The
products are aqueous bromine and aqueous potassium chloride.

Solution
Step 1:

The full balanced equation is:
Cl2(aq) + 2KBr(aq) →
Br2(aq) + 2KCl(aq)

Step 2:

The ions present are:
Cl2(aq) + 2K+(aq) + 2Br−(aq) →
Br2(aq) + 2K+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq)

Step 3:

Cancel the spectator ions:
Cl2(aq) +

+ 2Br−(aq) →

Br2(aq) +
Step 4:

+ 2Cl−(aq)

Write the final ionic equation:
Cl2(aq) + 2Br−(aq) → Br2(aq) + 2Cl−(aq)

Questions
18 Change these full equations to ionic equations.
a

H2SO4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(I)

b

Br2(aq) + KI(aq) → 2KBr(aq)+I2

19 Write ionic equations for these precipitation reactions.
a

CuSO4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → Cu(OH)2(s) + Na2SO4(aq)

b

Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2KI(aq) → PbI2(s) + 2KNO3(aq)

Chemists usually prefer to write ionic equations for precipitation reactions. A precipitation reaction is a
reaction where two aqueous solutions react to form a solid: the precipitate. For these reactions the method
of writing the ionic equation can be simplified. All you have to do is:
write the formula of the precipitate as the product
write the ions that go to make up the precipitate as the reactants.

WORKED EXAMPLE
20 An aqueous solution of iron(II) sulfate reacts with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. A
precipitate of iron(II) hydroxide is formed, together with an aqueous solution of sodium sulfate.

Solution

Step 1:

Write the full balanced equation
FeSO4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → Fe(OH)2(s) + Na2SO4(aq)

Step 2:

Identify the precipitate formed:
Fe(OH)2(s)

Step 3:

Identify the ions which form the precipitate:
Fe2+(aq) and OH−(aq)

Step 4:

Write the ionic equation:
Fe2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) → Fe(OH)2(s)

3.7 Solutions and concentration
Calculating the concentration of a solution
The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute dissolved in a solvent to make 1 dm3 (one cubic
decimetre) of solution. The solvent is usually water. There are 1000 cm3 in a cubic decimetre. When 1
mole of a compound is dissolved to make 1 dm3 of solution the concentration is 1 mol dm−3.
concentration (mol dm−3) =
We use the terms ‘concentrated’ and ‘dilute’ to refer to the relative amount of solute in the solution. A
solution with a low concentration of solute is a dilute solution. If there is a high concentration of solute, the
solution is concentrated.
When performing calculations involving concentrations in mol dm−3 you need to:
change mass in grams to moles
change cm3 to dm3 (by dividing the number of cm3 by 1000).

IMPORTANT
When making solutions of known concentration, you dissolve a weighed amount of solute in a small
amount of solvent. Then you make it up to the required volume by adding more solvent. You do not
add the solute to the required final volume of solvent because the total volume of the solution may
then change.

WORKED EXAMPLE
21 Calculate the concentration in mol dm−3 of sodium hydroxide, NaOH, if 250 cm3 of a solution
contains 2.0 g of sodium hydroxide.

Solution
(Mr value: NaOH = 40.0)
Step 1:

Change grams to moles.
= 0.050 mol NaOH

Step 2:

Change cm3 to dm3.
250 cm3 = 0.25 dm3

Step 3:

Calculate concentration.
= 0.20 mol dm−3

Figure 3.20: The concentration of chlorine in the water in a swimming pool must be carefully controlled.

We often need to calculate the mass of a substance present in a solution of known concentration and
volume. To do this we:
rearrange the concentration equation to:
number of moles (mol) = concentration (mol dm−3) × volume (dm3)
multiply the moles of solute by its molar mass
mass of solute (g) = number of moles (mol) × molar mass (g mol−1)

WORKED EXAMPLE
22 Calculate the mass of anhydrous copper(II) sulfate in 55 cm3 of a 0.20 mol dm−3 solution of
copper(II) sulfate. (Ar values: Cu = 63.5, O = 16.0, S = 32.1)

Solution
Step 1:

Change cm3 to dm3.
= 0.055 dm3

Step 2:

moles = concentration (mol dm−3) × volume of solution (dm3)
= 0.20 × 0.055 = 0.011 mol

Step 3:

mass (g) = moles × M
= 0.011 × (63.5 + 32.1 + (4 × 16.0))
= 1.8 g (to 2 significant figures)

Question

solution

solution.

40 cm3 of aqueous nitric acid of concentration 0.2 mol dm−3

ii

50 cm3 of calcium hydroxide solution of concentration 0.01 mol dm−3.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 3.2
Carrying out a titration
A procedure called a titration is used to determine the amount of substance present in a solution of
unknown concentration. There are several different kinds of titration. One of the commonest involves
the exact neutralisation of an alkali by an acid (Figure 3.21).

Figure 3.21: a A funnel is used to fill the burette with hydrochloric acid. b A graduated pipette is used to measure
25.0 cm3 of sodium hydroxide solution into a conical flask. c An indicator called litmus is added to the sodium
hydroxide solution, which turns blue. d 12.5 cm3 of hydrochloric acid from the burette have been added to the 25.0
cm3 of alkali in the conical flask. The litmus has gone red, showing that this volume of acid was just enough to
neutralise the alkali.

If we want to determine the concentration of a solution of sodium hydroxide of unknown concentration
we use the following procedure.
Use a volumetric pipette to place a given volume (usually 10 cm3 or 25 cm3) of sodium hydroxide of
unknown concentration into a flask.
Get some of acid of known concentration, e.g. hydrochloric acid of concentration 1.00 mol dm−3
Fill a clean burette with the acid (after having washed the burette with a little of the acid).
Record the initial burette reading.
Add a few drops of an indicator solution to the alkali in the flask, e.g. methyl orange.
Slowly add the acid from the burette to the flask, swirling the flask all the time until the indicator
changes colour (the end-point).
Record the final burette reading. The final reading minus the initial reading is called the titre. This
first titre is normally known as a ‘rough’ value.
Repeat this process, adding the acid drop by drop near the end-point.
Repeat again, until you have two titres that are no more than 0.10 cm3 apart.
Take the average of these two titre values.
Your results should be recorded in a table, looking like this:
Rough

Table 3.9: Example results table.

You should note:
all burette readings are given to an accuracy of 0.05 cm3
the units are shown like this: / cm3
the two titres that are no more than 0.10 cm3 apart are 1 and 3, so they would be averaged
the average titre is 34.70 cm3.
In every titration there are five important things you need to know or work out:
1

the balanced equation for the reaction

2

the volume of the solution from the burette (in this example this is hydrochloric acid)

3

the concentration of the solution in the burette

4

the volume of the solution in the titration flask (in this example this is sodium hydroxide)

5

the concentration of the solution in the titration flask.

If we know four of these five things, we can calculate the fifth. So, in order to calculate the
concentration of sodium hydroxide in the flask, we need to know the first four of these points.

Calculating solution concentration by titration
A titration is often used to find the exact concentration of a solution. Worked example 23 shows the steps
used to calculate the concentration of a solution of sodium hydroxide when it is neutralised by aqueous
sulfuric acid of known concentration and volume.

WORKED EXAMPLE
23 25.0 cm3 of a solution of sodium hydroxide is exactly neutralised by 15.10 cm3 of sulfuric acid of
concentration 0.200 mol dm−3.
2NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2H2O
Calculate the concentration, in mol dm−3, of the sodium hydroxide solution.

Solution
Step 1:

Calculate how many moles of acid.
moles = concentration (mol dm−3) ×
volume of solution (dm3)
0.200 ×

Step 2:

= 0.00302 mol H2SO4

Use the stoichiometry of the balanced equation to calculate how many moles of NaOH.
moles of NaOH =
moles of acid (from step 1) × 2
= 0.00604 mol

Step 3:

Calculate the concentration of NaOH.

Note:
In the first step we use the reagent for which the concentration and volume are both known.
In step 2, we multiply by 2 because the balanced equation shows that 2 mol of NaOH reacts with
every 1 mol of H2SO4.
In step 3, we divide by 0.0250 because we have changed cm3 to dm3 0.0250 =
The answer is given to 3 significant figures because the smallest number of significant figures in
the data is 3.

IMPORTANT
When doing calculations from the results of titrations, remember:
average only those titres which are very close to each other, e.g. within 0.1–0.2 cm3 of each other,
and ignore the rough (rangefinder) titration.
keep the units the same. It is often easier to convert volumes in cm3 to dm3 because solution
concentration is usually given in mol dm−3.
Note that in some older books M is sometimes used in place of mol dm−3.

Question
21 a

The equation for the reaction of strontium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid is shown below.
Sr(OH)2 + 2HCl → SrCl2 + 2H2O
25.0 cm3 of a solution of strontium hydroxide was exactly neutralised by 15.00 cm3 of 0.100 mol
dm−3 hydrochloric acid. Calculate the concentration, in mol dm−3, of the strontium hydroxide
solution.

b

20.0 cm3 of a 0.400 mol dm−3 solution of sodium hydroxide was exactly neutralised by 25.25 cm3
of sulfuric acid. Calculate the concentration, in mol dm−3, of the sulfuric acid. The equation for the
reaction is:
H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O

Deducing stoichiometry by titration
We can use titration results to find the stoichiometry of a reaction. In order to do this, we need to know the
concentrations and the volumes of both the reactants. Worked example 24 shows how to determine the
stoichiometry of the reaction between a metal hydroxide and an acid.

WORKED EXAMPLE
24 25.0 cm3 of a 0.0500 mol dm−3 solution of a metal hydroxide was titrated against a solution of 0.200
mol dm−3 hydrochloric acid. It required 12.50 cm3 of hydrochloric acid to exactly neutralise the
metal hydroxide. Deduce the stoichiometry of this reaction.

Solution
Step 1:

Calculate the number of moles of each reagent.

Step 2:

Deduce the simplest mole ratio of metal hydroxide to hydrochloric acid.
1.25 × 10−3 moles of hydroxide : 2.50 × 10−3 moles of acid = 1 hydroxide : 2 acid

Step 3:

Write the equation.
M(OH)2 + 2HCl → MCl2 + 2H2O

One mole of hydroxide ions neutralises one mole of hydrogen ions. As one mole of the metal
hydroxide neutralises two moles of hydrochloric acid, the metal hydroxide must contain two
hydroxide ions in each formula unit.

Questions
22 20.0 cm3 of a metal hydroxide of concentration 0.0600 mol dm−3 was titrated with 0.100 mol dm−3
hydrochloric acid. It required 24.00 cm3 of the hydrochloric acid to exactly neutralise the metal
hydroxide.

B

The concentration of aluminium ions is 0.8 mol dm−3.

C

3.8 Calculations involving gas volumes
Using the molar gas volume
In 1811 the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro suggested that equal volumes of all gases contain the same
number of molecules. This is called Avogadro’s hypothesis. This idea is approximately true as long as the
pressure is not too high or the temperature too low. It is convenient to measure volumes of gases at room
temperature (20 °C) and pressure (1 atmosphere). At room temperature and pressure (r.t.p.) one mole of
any gas has a volume of 24.0 dm3. So, 24.0 dm3 of carbon dioxide and 24.0 dm3 of hydrogen both contain
one mole of gas molecules.
We can use the molar gas volume of 24.0 dm3 at r.t.p. to find:
the volume of a given mass or number of moles of gas
the mass or number of moles of a given volume of gas.

WORKED EXAMPLES
25 Calculate the volume of 0.40 mol of nitrogen at r.t.p.

Solution

26 Calculate the mass of methane, CH4, present in 120 cm3 of methane. (Mr value: methane = 16.0)

Solution
120 cm3 is 0.120 dm3

Question
24 a

Calculate the volume, in dm3, occupied by 26.4 g of carbon dioxide at r.t.p.
(Ar values: C = 12.0, O = 16.0)

b

A flask of volume 120 cm3 is filled with helium gas at r.t.p. Calculate the mass of helium present
in the flask. (Ar value: He = 4.0)

Figure 3.22: Anaesthetists have to know about gas volumes so that patients remain unconscious during major
operations.

Gas volumes and stoichiometry
We can use the ratio of reacting volumes of gases to deduce the stoichiometry of a reaction. If we mix 20
cm3 of hydrogen with 10 cm3 of oxygen and explode the mixture, we will find that the gases have exactly
reacted together and no hydrogen or oxygen remains. According to Avogadro’s hypothesis, equal volumes
of gases contain equal numbers of molecules and therefore equal numbers of moles of gases. So the mole
ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 2 : 1. We can summarise this as:

We can extend this idea to experiments involving combustion data of hydrocarbons. Worked example 27
shows how the formula of propane and the stoichiometry of the equation can be deduced. Propane is a
hydrocarbon: a compound of carbon and hydrogen only.

WORKED EXAMPLE
27 When 50 cm3 of propane reacts exactly with 250 cm3 of oxygen, 150 cm3 of carbon dioxide is
formed.
propane + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water

As 1 mole of propane produces 3 moles of carbon dioxide, there must be 3 moles of carbon atoms in
one mole of propane, x = 3.
C3Hy + 5O2 → 3CO2 + zH2O
The 5 moles of oxygen molecules are used to react with both the carbon and the hydrogen in the
propane. 3 moles of these oxygen molecules have been used in forming carbon dioxide. So 5 − 3 =
2 moles of oxygen molecules must be used in reacting with the hydrogen to form water. There are 4
moles of atoms in 2 moles of oxygen molecules, so there must be 4 moles of water formed.
C3Hy + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O

So there must be 8 hydrogen atoms in 1 molecule of propane.
C3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O

SUMMARY
Unified atomic mass unit is one twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.
Relative atomic mass is the ratio of the weighted average mass of atoms in a given sample of an element to the
unified atomic mass unit.
The mass spectrometer can be used to determine atomic masses and isotopic abundances, to deduce the molecular
mass of an organic compound and to deduce the formula of an organic molecule from its fragmentation pattern and
isotopic ratios.
One mole of a substance is the amount of substance that has the Avogadro number of specified particles (6.02 ×
1023). The particles can be atoms, molecules, ions or electrons.
Molecular formulae show the total number of atoms of each element present in one molecule or one formula unit of
the compound. Empirical formulae show the simplest whole number ratio of atoms in a compound.
The mole concept can be used to calculate:
reacting masses
volumes of gases
volumes and concentrations of solutions.
The stoichiometry of a reaction can be obtained from calculations involving reacting masses, gas volumes, and
volumes and concentrations of solutions.

BEFORE YOU START
1

Take it in turns to explain to another learner what is meant by each of the following:
a

covalent bonding

b

ionic bonding

c

metallic bonding

d

intermolecular forces

Mention the types of particles that are responsible for the attractive forces between the atoms or
ions.

3

Make a list of the typical physical properties of metals such as iron and non-meals such as sulfur.
Compare your list with the list made by others in the class.

4

Ask another learner to select one of the first 20 elements in the Periodic Table. Can you deduce the
simple electronic configuration for an atom of this element? Take turns in doing this until you are
sure that you can write simple electronic configurations.

5

Explain to another learner how to work out the number of electrons in the outer principal energy
level of atoms in Groups 1 and 2 and in Groups 13–18 (you may know Groups 13 to 18 as Groups 3
to 8)

6

Ask another learner to select one of the positive ions: sodium, magnesium or calcium, and one of
the negative ions: oxygen, chlorine or bromine. Draw the simple electronic configuration for the
positive and negative ions selected and then draw a dot-and-cross diagram for the compound
formed from these ions.

7

How confident are you in drawing dot-and-cross diagrams for molecules? Without looking at a
textbook, work with a partner to draw dot-and-cross diagrams for the following molecules:

Try this problem by yourself and then discuss your ideas with a partner.
Lone pairs of electrons repel each other more than a pair of electrons in a bond. Draw the
electronic structure of a methane molecule and a water molecule and suggest why the methane
molecule has an H─C─H bond angle of about 109.5° but a water molecule has an H─O─H bond
angle of 104.5°.

SKATING ON WATER

Figure 4.1: The intermolecular forces in water allow some insects to skate over its surface.

Some insects can skate across the surface of a pond (Figure 4.1). How do they do this? Part of the
answer is that water has unusual physical properties due to the strong forces of attraction
(intermolecular forces) between the water molecules. The unusually strong intermolecular forces in
water are due to hydrogen bonding. These attractive forces make it more difficult for water molecules
to slide over each other compared with most other liquids. A water molecule below the surface is
attracted equally in all directions to other water molecules. At the surface, where water and air meet,
there is hardly any attraction between the molecules in the air and the water molecules. But the water
molecules at the surface are strongly attracted to each other. So there is a downward force at the
surface of the liquid which pulls the surface inwards. This surface tension causes the surface of the
water to appear to have an elastic skin. You can float a paper clip on water to demonstrate surface
tension:
Fill a glass right up to the top with water.
Take a paper clip and lower it gently onto the surface of the water using a fork.
Skating insects take advantage of the high surface tension of water by having special features such as
wide feet. These feet are also covered in a hard layer which repels water.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Suggest why skating insects have wide feet and not narrow feet.
Can you think of any liquids that do not mix with water and are lighter than water?
Suggest why a soft paper-like layer on insect’s feet would not allow them to stay on the surface of
the water.
Imagine that you are designing an insect that can skate perfectly on water. What other features
would be useful?

4.1 Types of chemical bonding
IMPORTANT
When elements form compounds, they either gain, lose or share electrons to get to the nearest stable
noble gas electronic configuration. There are exceptions to this rule for some Group 15, 16 and 17
elements.
Ionic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions) in
an ionic crystal lattice. Covalent bonds are formed when the outer electrons of two atoms are shared. The
ionic or covalent bonds formed are usually very strong: it takes a lot of energy to break them. There is also
a third form of strong bonding: metallic bonding.
Although the atoms within molecules are kept together by strong covalent bonds, the forces between
molecules are weak. We call these weak forces between molecules van der Waals’ forces. The term van
der Waals’ forces is a general term used to describe all intermolecular forces.
There are several types of van der Waals forces:
dipole (instantaneous dipole–induced dipole (id–id) forces. These are also called London dispersion
forces.
permanent dipole–permanent dipole (pd–pd) forces.
hydrogen bonding, which is a stronger form of permanent dipole–permanent dipole force.
If you understand these different types of chemical bonding and understand intermolecular forces, this will
help you to explain the structure and some physical properties of elements and compounds.

4.2 Ionic bonding
How are ions formed?
One way of forming ions is for atoms to gain or lose one or more electrons.
Positive ions are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. Metal atoms usually lose electrons
and form positive ions.
Negative ions are formed when an atom gains one or more electrons. Non-metal atoms usually gain
electrons and form negative ions.
The charge on the ion depends on the number of electrons lost or gained (see Section 2.4).
When metals combine with non-metals, the electrons in the outer shell of the metal atoms are transferred
to the non-metal atoms. Each non-metal atom usually gains enough electrons to fill its outer shell. As a
result of this, the metal atoms and non-metal atoms usually end up with outer electron shells that are
complete: they have the electronic configuration of a noble gas.
In Figure 4.2 we can see that:
the sodium ion has the same electronic structure as neon: [2,8]+
the chloride ion has the same electronic structure as argon: [2,8,8]−.
The strong force of attraction between the positive ions and negative ions in the ionic crystal lattice results
in an ionic bond. An ionic bond is sometimes called an electrovalent bond. In an ionic structure such as
sodium chloride crystals (Figure 4.3), the ions are arranged in a regular repeating pattern (see Chapter 5).
As a result of this, the force between one ion and the ions of opposite charge that surround it is very great.
In other words, ionic bonding is very strong.

Figure 4.2: The formation of a sodium ion and chloride ion by electron transfer.

Figure 4.3: These crystals of salt are made up of millions of sodium ions and chloride ions.

Dot-and-cross diagrams
You will notice that in Figure 4.2 we use dots and crosses to show the electronic configuration of the
chloride and sodium ions. This helps us keep track of where the electrons have come from. It does not
mean that the electron transferred is any different from the others. Diagrams like this are called dot-andcross diagrams.
When drawing a dot-and-cross diagram for an ionic compound it is usually acceptable to draw the outer
electron shell of the metal ion without any electrons. This is because it has transferred these electrons to
the negative ion. Figure 4.4 shows the outer shell dot-and-cross diagram for sodium chloride.
A dot-and-cross diagram shows:
the outer electron shells only
the charge of the ion is spread evenly, by using square brackets
the charge on each ion, written at the top right-hand corner.

Figure 4.4: Dot-and-cross diagram for sodium chloride.

Some examples of dot-and-cross diagrams
Magnesium oxide
When magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide, the two electrons in the outer shell of
each magnesium atom are transferred to the incompletely filled orbitals of an oxygen atom. By losing two
electrons, each magnesium atom achieves the electronic configuration [2,8] (Figure 4.5). By gaining two
electrons, each oxygen atom achieves the electronic configuration [2,8]. [2,8] is the electronic
configuration of neon. It is sometimes called a noble-gas configuration. When ions or atoms have 8
electrons in their outer shell like this it is called an octet of electrons (the prefix oct means 8).

Figure 4.5: Dot-and-cross diagram for magnesium oxide.

Calcium fluoride
Each calcium atom has two electrons in its outer shell, and these can be transferred to two fluorine atoms.
By losing two electrons, each calcium atom achieves the electronic configuration [2,8,8] (Figure 4.6). The
two fluorine atoms each gain one electron to achieve the electronic configuration [2,8]. [2,8] is the
electronic configuration of neon; it is a ‘noble-gas configuration’.

4.3 Covalent bonding
Single covalent bonds
When two non-metal atoms combine, they share one or more pairs of electrons. A shared pair of electrons
is called a single covalent bond, or a bond pair. A single covalent bond is represented by a single line
between the atoms: for example, Cl─Cl.
You can see that when chlorine atoms combine not all the electrons are used in bonding. The pairs of outershell electrons not used in bonding are called lone pairs.

Figure 4.7: a Bromine and b iodine are elements. They both have simple covalent molecules.

Each atom in a chlorine molecule has three lone pairs of electrons and shares one bonding pair of electrons
(Figure 4.8).

Figure 4.8: Atoms of chlorine share electrons to form a single covalent bond.

IMPORTANT
A dot-and-cross diagram shows the arrangement of the electrons in the main energy levels. We
generally only show the outer energy level when we draw dot-and-cross diagrams. Remember that we
only draw the electrons as dots and crosses to show us which atoms the electrons come from.
When drawing the arrangement of electrons in a molecule:
use a ‘dot’ for electrons from one of the atoms and a ‘cross’ for the electrons from the other atom
if there are more than two types of atom, use additional symbols such as a small circle or a small
triangle
draw the outer electrons in pairs, to show the number of bond pairs and the number of lone pairs.
Some examples of dot-and-cross diagrams for simple covalently bonded molecules are shown in Figure 4.9.

Figure 4.9: Dot-and-cross diagrams for some covalent compounds: a hydrogen, H2, b methane, CH4, c water, H2O, d
ammonia, NH3, e hydrogen chloride, HCl and f ethane, C2H6.

There are some cases in which the electrons around a central atom may not have a noble gas configuration
(an octet of electrons). For example:
boron trifluoride, BF3, has only six electrons around the boron atom. We say that the boron atom is
‘electron deficient’.
sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, has twelve electrons around the central sulfur atom. We say that the sulfur
atom has an ‘expanded octet’ (Figure 4.10).
phosphorus(V) chloride, PCl5, has 10 electrons around the central phosphorus atom. Phosphorus has
expanded its octet (Figure 4.10).
sulfur dioxide, SO2, the sulfur atom forms a double bond with each oxygen atom. This leaves a pair of
non-bonding electrons on the sulfur atom. There are 10 electrons around the sulfur atom. Sulfur has
expanded its octet (Figure 4.10).

Figure 4.10: Dot-and-cross diagrams for a boron trifluoride, BF3, b sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, c phosphorus(V) chloride, PCl5
and d sulfur dioxide, SO2.

Some elements in Periods 15, 16 and 17 have more than 8 electrons in their outer shell when they form
compounds. According to one theory they use unfilled p-orbitals or d-orbitals in the third main energy level
for the extra electrons. Some common examples of this expansion of the octet are seen in compounds of
phosphorus, sulfur and chlorine with oxygen or fluorine.

Question

electron shells. Note that in part d the beryllium atom is electron deficient and in part e the antimony
atom has an expanded octet.
a

tetrachloromethane, CCl4

b

phosphorus(III) chloride

c

d

beryllium chloride, BeCl2

e

Multiple covalent bonds

Some atoms can bond together by sharing two pairs of electrons. We call this a double covalent bond. A
double covalent bond is represented by a double line between the atoms: for example, O═O. The dotand-cross diagrams for oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethene, all of which have double covalent bonds, are
shown in Figure 4.11.
In order to form an oxygen molecule, each oxygen atom needs to gain two electrons to complete its
outer shell so two pairs of electrons are shared and two covalent bonds are formed.
For carbon dioxide, each oxygen atom needs to gain two electrons as before. But the carbon atom
needs to gain four electrons to complete its outer shell. So two oxygen atoms each form two bonds
with carbon, so that the carbon atom has eight electrons around it.
In ethene, two hydrogen atoms share a pair of electrons with each carbon atom. This leaves each
carbon atom with two outer shell electrons for bonding with each other. A double bond is formed
between the two carbon atoms.

Figure 4.11: Dot-and-cross diagrams for a oxygen, O2, b carbon dioxide, CO2, and c ethene, C2H4.

Atoms can also bond together by sharing three pairs of electrons. We call this a triple covalent bond.
Figure 4.12 shows a dot-and-cross diagram for the triple-bonded nitrogen molecule.
In order to form a nitrogen molecule, each nitrogen atom needs to gain three electrons to complete its
outer shell. So three pairs of electrons are shared and three covalent bonds are formed.

Figure 4.12: Dot-and-cross diagram for a nitrogen molecule, N2.

Question
3

Draw dot-and-cross diagrams for the following covalently bonded molecules. Show only the outer
electron shells:
a

carbonyl chloride O═CCl2

b

carbon disulfide, CS2.

Co-ordinate bonding (dative covalent bonding)
A co-ordinate bond (or dative covalent bond) is formed when one atom provides both the electrons
needed for a covalent bond.
For dative covalent bonding we need:
one atom to have a lone pair of electrons
a second atom to have an unfilled orbital to accept the lone pair. In other words, an electron-deficient
compound.
An example of this is the ammonium ion, NH4+, formed when ammonia combines with a hydrogen ion, H+.
The hydrogen ion is electron deficient. It has space for two electrons in its shell. The nitrogen atom in the
ammonia molecule has a lone pair of electrons. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom provides both electrons
for the bond (Figure 4.13).

Figure 4.13: The formation of a co-ordinate bond in the ammonium ion.

In a displayed formula (which shows all atoms and bonds), a co-ordinate bond is represented by an arrow.
The head of the arrow points away from the lone pair that forms the bond.
Another molecule that has co-ordinate bonds is aluminium chloride. At high temperatures aluminium
chloride exists as molecules with the formula AlCl3. This molecule is electron deficient. It still needs two
electrons to complete the outer shell of the aluminium atom. At lower temperatures two molecules of AlCl3
combine to form a molecule with the formula Al2Cl6. The AlCl3 molecules are able to combine because lone
pairs of electrons on two of the chlorine atoms form co-ordinate bonds with the aluminium atoms, as shown
in Figure 4.14.

Figure 4.14: A dot-and-cross diagram for an aluminium chloride molecule, Al2Cl6.

IMPORTANT
A displayed formula shows all of the atoms and all of the bonds. You do not have to show the correct
bond angles in a displayed formula.

ii

phosphine, PH3, and a hydrogen ion, H+, to form the ion PH4+.

Draw the displayed formulae of the products formed in part a. Show the co-ordinate bond by an
arrow.

Bond length and bond energy
In general, double bonds are shorter than single bonds. This is because double bonds have a greater
quantity of negative charge between the two atomic nuclei. The greater force of attraction between the
electrons and the nuclei pulls the atoms closer together. This results in a stronger bond. We measure the
strength of a bond by its bond energy. This is the energy needed to break one mole of a given covalent
bond in the gaseous state (see also Chapter 6). The distance from the nucleus of one atom to another
depends on the two atoms forming the bond. The internuclear distance between two covalently bonded
atoms is called the bond length. Table 4.1 shows some values of bond lengths and bond energies.

Table 4.1: Examples of values for bond energies and bond lengths.

Bond strength can influence the reactivity of a compound. The molecules in liquids and gases are in
random motion so they are constantly colliding with each other. A reaction only happens between
molecules when a collision occurs with enough energy to break bonds in either or both molecules. Nitrogen
is unreactive because it has a triple bond, N≡N. It takes a lot of energy to break the nitrogen atoms apart.
The bond energy required is 994 kJ mol−1. Oxygen is much more reactive. Although it has a double bond, it
only takes 496 kJ to break a mole of O═O bonds. However, bond strength is only one factor that influences
the reactivity of a molecule. The polarity of the bond (see Section 4.7) and whether the bond is a σ bond
(sigma bond) or a π bond (pi bond) (see Section 4.5) both play a large part in determining chemical
reactivity.

4.4 Shapes of molecules
Valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR)
Because all electrons have the same (negative) charge, they repel each other when they are close
together. So, a pair of electrons in the bonds surrounding the central atom in a molecule will repel other
electron pairs. This repulsion forces the pairs of electrons apart until the repulsive forces are minimised.
The shape and bond angles of a covalently bonded molecule depend on:
the number of pairs of electrons around each atom
whether these pairs are lone pairs or bonding pairs.

IMPORTANT
VSEPR:
The valence shell electrons are the electrons in the main outer shell.
Pairs of electrons repel each other because they have the same charge.
A lone pair of electrons repel each other more than a bonded pair of electrons.
Repulsion between multiple and single bonds is treated the same as for repulsion between single
bonds. Repulsions between pairs of double bonds are greater.
The shape of a molecule can be deduced using this theory, with the most stable shape being that
which minimises the forces of repulsion.

Lone pairs of electrons have a more concentrated electron charge cloud than bonding pairs of electrons.
Their cloud charges are wider and slightly closer to the nucleus of the central atom. This results in a
different amount of repulsion between different types of electron pairs. The order of repulsion is lone pair–
lone pair (most repulsion) > lone pair–bond pair > bond pair–bond pair (least repulsion).
Figure 4.15 shows the repulsions between lone pairs (pink) and bonding pairs (white) in a water molecule.

Figure 4.15: Repulsion between lone and bonding electron pairs in water.

Working out the shapes of molecules
The differences in electron-pair repulsion determine the shape and bond angles in a molecule. Figure 4.16
compares the shapes and bond angles of methane, ammonia and water. Space-filling models of these
molecules are shown in Figure 4.17. Each of these molecules has four pairs of electrons surrounding the
central atom. Note that in drawing three-dimensional diagrams, the triangular ‘wedge’ is the bond coming
towards you and the dashed black line is the bond going away from you.
Methane has four bonding pairs of electrons surrounding the central carbon atom. The equal repulsive
forces of each bonding pair of electrons results in a structure with all H─C─H bond angles being 109.5°.
We call this a tetrahedral structure.
In ammonia and water, the tetrahedral arrangement of the electron pairs around the central atom
becomes distorted.
Ammonia has three bonding pairs of electrons and one lone pair. As lone pair–bond pair repulsion is

greater than bond pair–bond pair repulsion, the bonding pairs of electrons are pushed closer together.
This gives the ammonia molecule a pyramidal shape. The H─N─H bond angle is about 107°. We call
this a pyramidal structure.
Water has two bonding pairs of electrons and two lone pairs. The greatest force is between the two
lone pairs. This results in the bonds being pushed even closer together. The shape of the water
molecule is a non-linear V shape. The H─O─H bond angle is 104.5°.

Figure 4.16: The bond angles in a methane, b ammonia, and c water depend on the type of electron-pair repulsion.

Figure 4.17: Shapes of molecules. These space-filling models show the molecular shapes of a methane, CH4, b ammonia,
NH3, and c water, H2O.

Predict, using VSEPR theory, the shapes of the following molecules, which you drew in question 2
in Section 4.3:
i

tetrachloromethane, CCl4

ii

beryllium chloride, BeCl2

iii

phosphorus(III) chloride.

Draw dot-and-cross diagrams for the following molecules and then predict their shapes:
i

hydrogen sulfide, H2S

ii

phosphine, PH3.

WORKED EXAMPLE
1

Predict the shape and bond angles in a molecule of stibine, SbH3. Explain how you arrived at your
conclusions.

Solution
Step 1:

Use the Periodic Table to find to which groups the atoms belong.
Sb = 15

Step 2:

Deduce the number of electrons in the outer principal quantum shell.
Sb = 5, H = 1

Step 3:

Draw a dot-and-cross diagram for the molecule.
In this case you should recognise the similarity to structure of ammonia. So there will
be 3 bonding pairs of electrons and 1 lone pair.

Step 4:

Use VSEPR theory to work out approximate bond angles.
Repulsion between lone pair and bond pair electrons is greater than repulsions between
a bonding pair and a bonding pair. So for four pairs of electrons, the H─Sb─H bond angle
is reduced from the tetrahedral bond angle to lower than 109.5° (the tetrahedral bond
angle). Any suitable value lower than about 107° (the value of ammonia is a suitable
estimate). But the value should be above 90°. (The actual value is 91.7°. The low value
is related to the large size of the Sb atom).

Step 5:

Deduce the shape.
You should recognise the similarity with the shape of ammonia which is pyramidal.

More molecular shapes
We can work out the shapes of other molecules by following the rules for electron-pair repulsion.

Boron trifluoride
Boron trifluoride is an electron-deficient molecule. It has only six electrons in its outer shell. The three
bonding pairs of electrons repel each other equally, so the F─B─F bond angles are 120° (Figure 4.18). We
describe the shape of the molecule as trigonal planar. Trigonal means having three angles.

Figure 4.18: Boron trifluoride.

Carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide has two carbon–oxygen double bonds and no lone pairs. The four electrons in each double
bond repel other electrons in a similar way to the two electrons in a single bond (Figure 4.19). So, the
O═C═O bond angle is 180°. We describe the shape of the carbon dioxide molecule as linear.

Figure 4.19: Carbon dioxide.

Phosphorus pentafluoride

Phosphorus pentafluoride has five bonding pairs of electrons and no lone pairs. The repulsion between the
electron pairs results in the most stable structure being one where two pyramids with bases of three angles
are joined (Figure 4.20). We call this structure trigonal bipyramidal. Three of the fluorine atoms lie in the
same plane as the phosphorus atom. The bond angles F─P─F within this plane are 120°. Two of the fluorine
atoms lie above and below this plane, at 90° to it.

Figure 4.20: Phosphorus pentafluoride.

Sulfur hexafluoride
Sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of electrons and no lone pairs. The equal repulsion between the
electron pairs results in the structure shown in Figure 4.21. All F─S─F bond angles are 90°. We describe the
shape as octahedral.

Figure 4.21: Sulfur hexafluoride.

4.5 σ bonds and π bonds
A single covalent bond is formed when two non-metal atoms combine. Each atom that combines has an
atomic orbital containing a single unpaired electron. In the formation of a covalent bond the atomic orbitals
overlap so that a combined orbital is formed, containing two electrons. We call this combined orbital a
molecular orbital. The amount of overlap of the atomic orbitals determines the strength of the bond: the
greater the overlap, the stronger the bond. Figure 4.22 shows how the s atomic orbitals of two hydrogen
atoms overlap to form a covalent bond.

IMPORTANT
Covalent bonds are formed when atomic orbitals overlap.

Figure 4.22: Two 1s atomic orbitals in hydrogen overlap to form a covalent bond.

The greater the overlap, the stronger the bond.
The mixing of atomic orbitals is called hybridisation. Mixing an s with three, two or one p-type orbitals
forms sp3, sp2 and sp hybrid orbitals.
Sigma bonds (σ bonds) are formed from end-on overlap of atomic orbitals. Pi bonds (π bonds) are
formed from sideways overlap of atomic orbitals.
The p atomic orbitals can also overlap linearly (end-on) to form covalent bonds. When p orbitals are
involved in forming single bonds, they become modified to include some s orbital character. The orbital is
slightly altered in shape to make one of the lobes of the p orbital bigger. The process of mixing atomic
orbitals (for example, one s orbital and three p orbitals) in this way is called hybridisation. The hybrids are
called sp3 hybrids. In sp3 hybrids, each orbital has

s character and

p character. When one s orbital and

two p orbitals are hybridised, the hybrids are called sp2 hybrids. When one s orbital and one p orbital are
hybridised, the hybrids are called sp orbitals. When hybridised orbitals overlap linearly (end-on) we call the
bond a σ bond (sigma bond). Figure 4.23 shows the formation of σ bonds.

Figure 4.23: Bonds are formed by the linear (end-on) overlap of atomic orbitals.

The electron density of each σ bond is symmetrical about a line joining the nuclei of the atoms forming the
bond.
Bonds formed by the sideways overlap of p orbitals are called π bonds (pi bonds). A π bond is not
symmetrical about the axes joining the nuclei of the atoms forming the bond. Figure 4.24 shows how a π
bond is formed from two p orbitals overlapping sideways.
We often draw a single π bond as two electron clouds, one arising from each lobe of the p orbitals. You

must remember, though, that the two clouds of electrons in a π bond represent one bond consisting of a
total of two electrons.

Figure 4.24: π bonds are formed by the sideways overlap of atomic orbitals.

The shape of some organic molecules
We can explain the shapes of molecules in terms of the patterns of electron density found in σ bonds and π
bonds.

Ethane
The displayed formula for ethane is:

All the bonds in ethane are formed by linear overlap of atomic orbitals. They are all σ bonds.
Figure 4.25 shows the electron density distribution in ethane formed by these σ bonds. All the areas of
electron density repel each other equally. This makes the H─C─H bond angles all the same (109.5°).

Figure 4.25: The electron density distribution in ethane.

Ethene
The displayed formula for ethene is:

Each carbon atom in ethene uses three of its four outer electrons to form σ bonds. Two σ bonds are formed
with the hydrogen atoms and one σ bond is formed with the other carbon atom.
The fourth electron from each carbon atom occupies a p orbital, which overlaps sideways with a similar p
orbital on the other carbon atom. This forms a π bond. Figure 4.26 shows how this occurs.

Figure 4.26: Overlap of p orbitals to produce a π bond in ethene.

The electron density distribution of both the σ and π bonds in ethene is shown in Figure 4.27.

Figure 4.27: The electron density distribution in ethene.

Ethene is a planar molecule because this ensures the maximum overlap of the p orbitals that form the π
bond. You will notice that the electron clouds that make up the π bond lie above and below the plane of the
carbon and hydrogen nuclei. We would expect the H─C─H bond angle in ethene to be about 120° because
the three areas of electron density of the σ bonds are equally distributed. However, because of the position
of the π bond, this bond angle is actually 117°. This minimises the repulsive forces.

Triple bonds
In the nitrogen molecule, N≡N, hydrogen cyanide, H─C≡N and ethyne, H─C≡C─H, there are triple bonds.
The triple bond is formed from two π bonds (pi bonds) and one σ bond (sigma bond). The two π bonds are
at right angles to each other.
In hydrogen cyanide one σ bond is formed between the hydrogen atom and the carbon atom (by overlap of
an sp carbon hybrid orbital with the 1s hydrogen orbital). A second σ bond is formed between the carbon
and the nitrogen atom (by overlap of an sp carbon hybrid orbital with a p orbital on the nitrogen). This
leaves the remaining p orbitals on each nitrogen atom to form two π bonds at right angles to each other.

Figure 4.28: Overlap of two sets of p orbitals of nitrogen and carbon to produce two π bonds in hydrogen cyanide.

4.6 Metallic bonding
What is a metallic bond?
In a metal, the atoms are packed closely together in a regular arrangement called a lattice. Metal atoms in
a lattice tend to lose their outer shell electrons and become positive ions. The outer shell electrons occupy
new energy levels and are free to move throughout the metal lattice. We call these electrons delocalised
electrons (mobile electrons). Delocalised electrons are electrons that are not associated with any one
particular atom or bond.
Metallic bonding is strong. This is because the ions are held together by the strong electrostatic
attraction between their positive charges and the negative charges of the delocalised electrons (Figures
4.29 and 4.30).

Figure 4.29: Metals: a sodium, b gold, c mercury, d magnesium and e copper.

Figure 4.30: Metallic bonding: there are strong attractive forces between the positively charged ions and the delocalised
electrons.

This electrostatic attraction acts in all directions. The strength of metallic bonding increases with:
increasing positive charge on the ions in the metal lattice
decreasing size of metal ions in the lattice
increasing number of mobile electrons per atom.

Metallic bonding and the properties of metals
We can use our model of metallic bonding to explain many of the properties of metals.
Most metals have high melting points and high boiling points
It takes a lot of energy to weaken the strong attractive forces between the metal ions and the delocalised
electrons. These attractive forces can only be overcome at high temperatures. However, mercury is a liquid
at room temperature (Figure 4.31). This is because some of the electrons in a mercury atom are bound
more tightly than usual to the nucleus, weakening the metallic bonds between atoms.

Figure 4.31: Mercury is a liquid at room temperature.

Metals conduct electricity
When a voltage is applied to a piece of metal, an electric current flows in it because the delocalised
electrons (mobile electrons) are free to move. Metallic bonding is the only type of bonding that allows us to
predict reliably that a solid will conduct electricity. Covalent solids cannot conduct electricity because none
of their electrons are free to move throughout the structure, although graphite is an exception to this. Ionic
solids cannot conduct because neither their electrons nor their ions are free to move from place to place.

Answer the following, giving a full explanation in terms of metallic bonding.
a

Explain why aluminium has a higher melting point than sodium.

b

The thermal conductivity of stainless steel is 82 W m−1 K−1. The thermal conductivity of copper is
400 W m−1 K−1. Why do some stainless steel saucepans have a copper base?

c

Why does aluminium conduct electricity better than sodium?

Metals conduct heat
The conduction of heat is partly due to the movement of the delocalised electrons but mainly due to the
vibrations passed on from one metal ion to the next.

4.7 Intermolecular forces
The forces within molecules due to covalent bonding are strong. However, the forces between molecules
are much weaker. We call these forces van der Waals’ forces (intermolecular forces).
There are two types of van der Waals’ (intermolecular) force:
instantaneous (temporary) dipole–induced dipole forces (id–id) forces. These are also called London
dispersion forces.
permanent dipole–permanent dipole (pd–pd) forces (including hydrogen bonding).
A special case of permanent dipole–permanent dipole forces is hydrogen bonding. This occurs between
molecules where hydrogen is bonded to a highly electronegative atom.

IMPORTANT
Remember that ‘van der Waals’ forces’ is a general term used for all intermolecular forces including id–
id forces, pd–pd forces and hydrogen bonding.
Table 4.2 compares the relative strength of these intermolecular forces and other bonds.

Table 4.2: Strengths of different types of bond and intermolecular force.

In order to understand how intermolecular forces work, we first have to know about electronegativity and
bond polarity.

Electronegativity
Electronegativity is the power of a particular atom that is covalently bonded to another atom to attract the
bonding pair of electrons towards itself.
The greater the value of the electronegativity, the greater the power of an atom to attract the electrons in
a covalent bond towards itself. For Groups 1 to 17 the pattern of electronegativity is:
electronegativity increases across a period from Group 1 to Group 17
electronegativity increases up each group.
This means that fluorine is the most electronegative element.
For the most electronegative elements, the order of electronegativity is:

Carbon and hydrogen have electronegativities that are lower than those of most other non-metallic
elements.

Factors influencing electronegativity
The value of the electronegativity depends on:

nuclear charge: atoms in the same period with a greater (positive) nuclear charge are more likely to
attract the bonding pair of electrons.
atomic radius: atoms in the same group in which the outer electrons are further from the nucleus are
less likely to attract the bonding pair of electrons because the pull of the positive nucleus on the
electron pair is lower.
shielding: the greater the number of inner electron shells and sub-shells, the lower the effective
nuclear charge on the bonding electrons.

Ionic or covalent?
The most commonly used scale of electronegativity values is called the Pauling electronegativity scale, NP.
Table 4.3 shows some Pauling electronegativity values.

Table 4.3: Some Pauling electronegativity values.

Note:
carbon (NP = 2.5) and hydrogen (NP = 2.1) have electronegativities that are lower than those of many
other non-metallic elements
Pauling electronegativity has no units.
Differences in electronegativity values can be used to predict whether a simple compound has ionic or
covalent bonds.
If the electronegativity difference is high, e.g. 2.0 or more, the compound is likely to be ionic. E.g.
sodium chloride: Na = 0.9, Cl = 3.0. Difference = 2.1.
If the electronegativity difference is lower, e.g. below 1.0, the compound is likely to be covalent. E.g.
methane: C = 2.5, H = 2.1. Difference = 0.4.
A zero value shows that there is no ionic character in the bond, e.g. Cl─Cl.
Some compounds are not entirely covalent and have some ionic character in them. These have
intermediate electronegativity differences, e.g. 1.0.

Polarity in molecules
When the electronegativity values of the two atoms forming a covalent bond are the same, the pair of
electrons is equally shared. We say that the covalent bond is non-polar. For example, hydrogen (H2),
chlorine (Cl2) and bromine (Br2) are non-polar molecules.
When a covalent bond is formed between two atoms having different electronegativity values, the more
electronegative atom attracts the pair of electrons in the bond towards it.
As a result:
the centre of positive charge does not coincide with the centre of negative charge
we say that the electron distribution is asymmetric
the two atoms are partially charged
we show:
the less electronegative atom with the partial charge δ+ (‘delta positive’)
the more electronegative atom with the partial charge δ– (‘delta negative’)
we say that the bond is polar (or that it has a dipole).
Figure 4.32 shows the polar bond in a hydrogen chloride molecule.

Figure 4.32: Hydrogen chloride is a polar molecule.

As the difference in electronegativity values of the atoms in a covalent bond increases, the bond becomes
more polar. The degree of polarity of a molecule is measured as a dipole moment. The direction of the
dipole is shown by the sign
. The arrow points to the partially negatively charged end of the
dipole.
In molecules containing more than two atoms, we have to take into account:
the polarity of each bond
the arrangement of the bonds in the molecule.
Trichloromethane, CHCl3, is a polar molecule. The three C─Cl dipoles point in a similar direction. Their
combined effect is not cancelled out by the polarity of the C─H bond. This is because the C─H bond is
virtually non-polar. The electron distribution is asymmetric. The molecule is polar, with the negative end
towards the chlorine atoms. This is shown in Figure 4.33a.
Some molecules contain polar bonds but have no overall polarity. This is because the polar bonds in these
molecules are arranged in such a fashion that the dipole moments cancel each other out. An example is
tetrachloromethane, CCl4 (Figure 4.33b). Tetrachloromethane has four polar C─Cl bonds pointing towards
the four corners of a tetrahedron. The dipoles in each bond cancel each other, so tetrachloromethane is
non-polar.

Figure 4.33: The polarity of a trichloromethane and b tetrachloromethane.

IMPORTANT
Remember that not all molecules with polar bonds are polar molecules. Sometimes the polar bonds
cancel each other out because the same types of bonds have dipoles ‘pulling’ in opposite directions.
We can determine the charge distribution in molecules and ions by a method called X-ray spectroscopy.
One method involves firing X-rays at molecules and measuring the energy of the electrons given off. Using
this method, scientists have found that in a sulfate ion, the sulfur atom has a charge of +1.12 units and the
four oxygen atoms each have a charge of –0.78 units.

b

hydrogen fluoride, HF

c

the V-shaped molecule, sulfur dichloride, SCl2

d

e

Polarity and chemical reactivity
Bond polarity influences chemical reactivity. For example, both nitrogen, N≡N, and carbon monoxide, C≡O,
have triple bonds requiring a similar amount of energy to break them. Nitrogen is a non-polar molecule and
is fairly unreactive. But carbon monoxide is a polar molecule, and this explains its reactivity with oxygen
and its use as a reducing agent. Many chemical reactions are started by a reagent attacking one of the
electrically charged ends of a polar molecule. For example, chloroethane, C2H5Cl, is far more reactive than
ethane, C2H6. This is because reagents such as OH− ions can attack the delta-positive carbon atom of the
polarised C─Cl bond (see also Section 16.2).

Such an attack is not possible with ethane because the C─H bond is virtually non-polar. This helps to
explain why alkanes such as ethane are not very reactive.

Instantaneous dipole–induced dipole (id–id) forces
Noble gases such as neon and argon exist as isolated atoms. Noble gases can be liquefied, but at very low
temperatures, so there must be very weak forces of attraction between their atoms. These weak forces
keep the atoms together in the liquid state.
Bromine is a non-polar molecule that is liquid at room temperature. The weak forces of attraction are
keeping the bromine molecules together at room temperature. These very weak forces of attraction are
called instantaneous dipole–induced dipole (id–id) forces, or London dispersion forces. These forces exist
between all atoms or molecules. So, how do these forces arise?
The electron charge clouds in a non-polar molecule (or atom) are constantly moving. It often happens that
more of the charge cloud is on one side of the molecule than the other. This means that one end of the
molecule has, for a short time, more negative charge than the other. A temporary dipole is set up. This
dipole can set up (induce) a dipole on neighbouring molecules. As a result of this, there are forces of
attraction between the δ+ end of the dipole in one molecule and the δ– end of the dipole in a neighbouring
molecule (Figure 4.34). These dipoles are always temporary because the electrons clouds are always
moving. Instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces are sometimes called temporary dipole–induced
dipole forces.
Instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces increase with:
increasing number of electrons (and protons) in the molecule
increasing the number of contact points between the molecules: contact points are places where the
molecules come close together.
Differences in the size of the instantaneous dipole–induced dipole (id–id) forces can be used to explain the
trend in the enthalpy change of vaporisation and boiling points of the noble gases. Figure 4.35 shows how
these vary with the number of electrons present. (The enthalpy change of vaporisation is the energy
required to convert a mole of liquid into a mole of gas.)

Figure 4.34: How instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces arise.

Figure 4.35: a Enthalpy changes of vaporisation and b boiling points of the noble gases plotted against the number of
electrons present.

You can see that both the enthalpy change of vaporisation and the boiling points of the noble gases
increase as the number of electrons increases (Figure 4.35). This is because the id–id forces between the
atoms are increased with an increasing number of electrons. So, more energy is needed to change the
liquid into vapour and the boiling point is higher.
The effect of increasing the number of contact points can be seen by comparing the boiling points of
pentane (boiling point 36 °C) and 2,2-dimethylpropane (boiling point 10 °C) (Figure 4.36). These
compounds have equal numbers of electrons in their molecules.
The molecules in pentane can line up beside each other so there is a large number of contact points. The
id–id forces are higher, so the boiling point is higher. The molecules of 2,2-dimethylpropane are more
compact. The surface area available for coming into contact with neighbouring molecules is smaller. The
id–id forces are relatively lower, so the boiling point is lower.
The id–id forces between individual atoms are very small. However, the total id–id forces between very long
non-polar molecules such as poly(ethene) molecules (see Section 15.5) can be much larger. That is why

poly(ethene) is a solid at room temperature.

Figure 4.36: The difference in boiling points of pentane and 2,2-dimethylpropane can be explained by the strength of the
instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces.

Two types of poly(ethene) are low-density poly(ethene), LDPE, and high-density poly(ethene), HDPE. Both
have crystalline and non-crystalline regions in them (Figure 4.37).

Figure 4.37: Crystalline and non-crystalline regions in poly(ethene).

HDPE has more crystalline regions where the molecules are closer together than LDPE. The total id–id
forces are greater, so HDPE is the stronger of the two.

Permanent dipole–permanent dipole (pd–pd) forces
In some molecules, the dipole is permanent. Molecules with a permanent dipole are called polar molecules.

A fine jet of polar molecules will be attracted towards an electrically charged plastic rod or comb. (The rod
can be charged by rubbing it with a woollen cloth.) Figure 4.38 shows the result of this experiment.

Figure 4.38: The deflection of water by an electrically charged nylon comb.

The molecules are always attracted to the charged rod, whether the rod is positively or negatively charged.
This is because the molecules have both negatively and positively charged ends.
The forces between two molecules having permanent dipoles are called permanent dipole–permanent
dipole (pd–pd) forces. The attractive force between the δ+ charge on one molecule and the δ– charge on
a neighbouring molecule causes a weak attractive force between the molecules (Figure 4.39).

Figure 4.39: Permanent dipole–permanent dipole forces in propanone.

For small molecules with the same number of electrons, permanent dipole–permanent dipole forces are
often stronger than instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces. For example, propanone (CH3COCH3, Mr =
58) has a higher boiling point than butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3, Mr = 58). This means that more energy is
needed to break the intermolecular forces between propanone molecules than between butane molecules)
(Figure 4.40).

Figure 4.40: The difference in the boiling points of propanone and butane can be explained by the different types of
intermolecular force between the molecules.

The permanent dipole–permanent dipole forces between propanone molecules are strong enough to make
this substance a liquid at room temperature. There are only instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces
between butane molecules. These forces are comparatively weak, so butane is a gas at room temperature.

Question
12 Bromine, Br2, and iodine monochloride, ICl, have the same number of electrons. But the boiling point
of iodine monochloride is nearly 40 °C higher than the boiling point of bromine. Explain this difference.

4.8 Hydrogen bonding
Note: Learners are only expected to describe hydrogen bonding in relation to molecules containing N─H
and O─H. The material in this section relating to the F─H group is extension material, and is not on the
syllabus.
Hydrogen bonding is the strongest form of intermolecular bonding. It is a type of permanent dipole–
permanent dipole bonding.
For hydrogen bonding to occur between two molecules we need:
one molecule to have a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to F, O or N (the three most electronegative
atoms)
a second molecule to have an F, O or N atom with an available lone pair of electrons.
For hydrogen bonding to happen the molecules must have:
a H atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom, e.g. N, O or F
another highly electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons.
When a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom, the bond is very highly
polarised. The δ+ charge on the hydrogen atom is high enough for a bond to be formed with a lone pair of
electrons on the F, O or N atom of a neighbouring molecule (Figure 4.41).

Figure 4.41: Hydrogen bonding between two ammonia molecules. A hydrogen bond is represented by a line of dots.

The force of attraction is about one-tenth of the strength of a normal covalent bond. For maximum bond
strength, the angle between the covalent bond to the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen bond is usually
180°.
The average number of hydrogen bonds formed per molecule depends on:
the number of hydrogen atoms attached to F, O or N in the molecule
the number of lone pairs present on the F, O or N.
Water has two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs per molecule (Figure 4.42). So water is extensively
hydrogen bonded with other water molecules. It has an average of two hydrogen bonds per molecule.

Figure 4.42: Water can form, on average, two hydrogen bonds per molecule.

Ammonia is less extensively hydrogen bonded than water (see Figure 4.41). It can form, on average, only
one hydrogen bond per molecule. Although each ammonia molecule has three hydrogen atoms attached to
the nitrogen atom, it has only one lone pair of electrons that can be involved in hydrogen bond formation.

a

Explain the trend in boiling points from HCl to HI.

b

Explain why the boiling point of HF is so much higher than the boiling point of HCl.

How does hydrogen bonding affect boiling point?
Some compounds have higher boiling points than expected. This can be due to hydrogen bonding. Figure
4.43 shows a graph of the boiling points of the hydrogen halides, HF, HCl, HBr and HI, plotted against the
position of the halogen in the Periodic Table.

Figure 4.43: The boiling points of the hydrogen halides.

The rise in boiling point from HCl to HI is due to the increasing number of electrons in the halogen atoms as
we go down the group. This leads to increased instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces as the molecules
get bigger. If hydrogen fluoride only had instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces between its molecules,

we would expect its boiling point to be about –90 °C. However, the boiling point of hydrogen fluoride is +20
°C, which is much higher. This is because of the stronger intermolecular forces of hydrogen bonding
between the HF molecules.

The peculiar properties of water
Enthalpy change of vaporisation and boiling point
Water has a much higher enthalpy change of vaporisation and boiling point than expected. This is due to
its extensive hydrogen bonding. Figure 4.44 shows the enthalpy changes of vaporisation of water and other
Group 16 hydrides.
The rise in enthalpy change of vaporisation from H2S to H2Te is due to the increasing number of electrons
in the Group 16 atoms as we go down the group. This leads to increased instantaneous dipole–induced
dipole forces as the molecules get bigger. If water only had instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces
between its molecules, we would expect its enthalpy change to be about 17 kJ mol−1. But the enthalpy
change of vaporisation of water is much higher. This is because water is extensively hydrogen bonded. The
boiling point of water is also much higher than predicted by the trend in boiling points for the other Group
16 hydrides. This also indicates that we need much more energy to break the bonds between water
molecules compared with other hydrides of Group 16 elements.

Figure 4.44: Enthalpy changes of vaporisation for Group 16 hydrides plotted against number of electrons present.

Surface tension and viscosity
Water has a high surface tension and high viscosity.

Hydrogen bonding reduces the ability of water molecules to slide over each other, so the viscosity of water
is high. The hydrogen bonds in water also exert a significant downward force at the surface of the liquid.
This causes the surface tension of water to be higher than for most liquids.

Ice is less dense than water
Most solids are denser than their liquids. This is because the molecules are more closely packed in the solid
state. But this is not true of water. In ice, there is a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network of water
molecules. This produces a rigid lattice in which each oxygen atom is surrounded by a tetrahedron of
hydrogen atoms. This ‘more open’ arrangement, due to the relatively long bond lengths of the hydrogen
bonds, allows the water molecules to be slightly further apart than in the liquid (Figures 4.45 and 4.46). So
the density of ice is less than that of liquid water.

Figure 4.45: Ice floats on water.

Figure 4.46: A model of ice. Oxygen atoms are red, hydrogen atoms are white, hydrogen bonds are lilac. This hydrogenbonded arrangement makes ice less dense than water.

4.9 Bonding and physical properties
The type of bonding between atoms, ions or molecules influences the physical properties of a substance.

IMPORTANT
Giant structures such as ionic structures, metals and carbon (graphite and diamond) generally have
high melting points but this does not give evidence about the type of bonding. If a substance has a low
melting point, it is a better indication that the bonding is covalent within the molecule and there are
weak van der Waals’ forces of attraction between the molecules (intermolecular forces).

Physical state at room temperature and pressure
Ionic compounds
Ionic compounds are solids at room temperature and pressure. This is because:
there are strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds) holding the positive and negative ions together
the ions are regularly arranged in a lattice (see Chapter 5), with the oppositely charged ions close to
each other.
Ionic compounds have high melting points, high boiling points and high enthalpy changes of vaporisation.
It takes a lot of energy to overcome the strong electrostatic attractive forces.

Metals
Metals, apart from mercury, are solids. Many metals have high melting points, high boiling points and high
enthalpy changes of vaporisation. This is because it takes a lot of energy to overcome the strong attractive
forces between the positive ions and the ‘sea’ of delocalised electrons.

IMPORTANT
Remember that not all metals have high melting points. Group 1 metals and mercury have lower
boiling points than some non-metals, so do not use high melting point as a characteristic of metals
unless you are only referring to transition elements.

Covalent compounds
Covalently bonded substances with simple molecular structures, for example, water and ammonia, are
usually liquids or gases. This is because the intermolecular forces are weak. It does not take much energy
to overcome these intermolecular forces. So these substances have low melting points, low boiling points
and low enthalpy changes of vaporisation compared with ionic compounds. Some substances that have
covalently bonded molecules may be solids at room temperature: for example, iodine and poly(ethene).
These are usually molecules where the total instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces are considerable.
However, the melting points of these substances are still fairly low compared with ionic compounds or most
metals.

Solubility
Ionic compounds
Most ionic compounds are soluble in water. This is because water molecules are polar and they are
attracted to the ions on the surface of the ionic solid. These attractions are called ion–dipole attractions
(see Section 19.4). These attractions replace the electrostatic forces between the ions and so the ions go
into solution.

Metals
Metals do not dissolve in water. The force of attraction between the ions and the delocalised electrons is
too great for water molecules to disrupt the structure and form bonds with the ions. However, some
metals, for example sodium and calcium, react with water rather than dissolving in water.

Covalent compounds
Covalently bonded substances with simple molecular structures fall into two groups.
Those that are insoluble in water. Most covalently bonded molecules are non-polar. Water molecules
are not attracted to them so they are insoluble. An example is iodine.
Those that are soluble in water. Small molecules that can form hydrogen bonds with water are
generally soluble. An example is ethanol, C2H5OH.
Some covalently bonded substances react with water rather than dissolving in it. For example, hydrogen
chloride reacts with water to form hydrogen ions and chloride ions, and the ions are soluble. Silicon
chloride reacts with water to form hydrogen ions, chloride ions and silicon dioxide. This reaction is called a
hydrolysis reaction.

Electrical conductivity
IMPORTANT
Remember that electrical conductivity in molten or aqueous ionic compounds is due to mobile ions.
Electrical conductivity in metals is due to mobile electrons.

Ionic compounds
Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity when in the solid state. This is because the ions are fixed in the
lattice and can only vibrate around a fixed point. When molten, an ionic compound conducts electricity
because the ions are mobile.

Metals
Metals conduct electricity both when solid and when molten. This is because the delocalised electrons
move throughout the structure when a voltage is applied.

Covalent compounds
Covalently bonded substances with simple molecular structures do not conduct electricity. This is because
they have neither ions nor electrons that are mobile.

REFLECTION
Work with another learner to make a mind map (spider diagram) of the different types of bonding that
you have learned about in this chapter. On your mind map include information about how different
types of bonding affect the physical properties of substances. Reflect on any ideas you both might
have on how you could improve your mind map.

SUMMARY
Ionic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. Covalent bonding is the electrostatic
attraction between the nuclei of two atoms and a shared pair of electrons.
Electronegativity is the power of a particular atom that is covalently bonded to another atom to attract the bonding
pair of electrons towards itself.
Bond energy is the energy required to break one mole of a particular covalent bond in the gaseous state. The units
of bond energy are kilojoules per mole, kJ mol−1.
The bond angles within molecules and the shapes of molecules can be predicted by VSEPR theory (lone pairs of
electrons repel each other more than bonding pairs of electrons).
Bonding can be described in terms of hybridisation of atomic orbitals and sigma (σ) bonds and pi (π) bonds.
Van der Waals’ forces can be classified as instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces (very weak), permanent
dipole–permanent dipole forces (slightly stronger) and hydrogen bonding (the strongest). Van der Waals’ forces are
weaker than covalent, ionic or metallic bonding.
Metallic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between positive ions and delocalised electrons.
Some of the physical properties of ionic, simple covalent molecules and metals can be related to the type of
bonding present.

LIQUID CRYSTALS: THE FOURTH STATE OF MATTER?

Figure 5.1: A liquid crystal display in action in a mobile phone.

Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) in mobile phones and computers are now part of everyday life (Figure
5.1). But how do they work?
When you heat crystals of cholesteryl benzoate to 147 °C, they melt to form a cloudy liquid. At 180 °C
the liquid becomes transparent. The cloudy state between the liquid and solid is called a liquid crystal
metaphase. Many substances with rod-shaped molecules form a metaphase. In the metaphase, the
molecules can move slightly. They have lost their regular arrangement but there is still some structure.

For example, they point in about the same direction or are twisted into a helix. The direction in which
the molecules face can be changed by small electric fields.
LCDs have a thin film of liquid crystal between two transparent plates. The plates are treated
chemically so that the liquid crystals arrange themselves in a particular way. The plates have an
electrically conducting coating on their inner surface. Light that enters the display unit goes through a
polariser, which makes the light vibrate in one plane. When the polarised light passes through the
liquid crystal it turns through 90°. The light then passes through a second polariser set at 90° to the
first. The display unit appears bright (Figure 5.2).

Figure 5.2: The bright and dark states of a liquid crystal (LCD) display.

When you apply a small voltage. the direction of the molecules changes so they no longer rotate in the
plane of the polarised light. The unit appears dark.
When the voltage is switched off the molecules go back to their original arrangement. By making the
conductive layer as separate small areas any pattern can be displayed and switched on or off by a
small voltage.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Compare the structures of a metaphase with a liquid and a solid. Is a metaphase another state of
matter or not?
How many hours a day do you spend looking at LCD screens (phone, computer, etc)? Do you think
this is good for you or not? Why do some people think that too much time spent on looking mobile
phone screens is a bad thing?

5.1 States of matter
Gases have no fixed shape or volume.
Gas particles:
are far apart, therefore gases can be compressed
are randomly arranged
can move freely from place to place, in all directions.
Liquids take the shape of the container they occupy.
Liquid particles:
are close together, so liquids have a fixed volume and can only be compressed slightly
are mostly arranged randomly
have limited movement from place to place, in all directions.
Solids have a fixed shape and volume.
Solid particles:
are touching each other, so solids cannot be compressed
are usually in a regular arrangement
cannot change positions with each other: they can only vibrate.

Question
1

Describe the changes that occur in the closeness and motion of the particles when:
a

a solid changes to a liquid

b

a liquid changes to a gas.

The state of a substance at room temperature and pressure depends on its structure and bonding. Four
types of structure are found in elements and compounds:
simple molecular or simple atomic, e.g. carbon dioxide, argon
giant ionic, e.g. sodium chloride
giant metallic, e.g. iron, copper
giant molecular, e.g. silicon(IV) oxide.
The simple atomic structures found in the noble gases generally have similar physical properties to simple
molecular gases. Although noble gases exist as isolated atoms, they can be thought of as having a
molecular structure.

5.2 The gaseous state
The kinetic theory of gases
The idea that molecules in gases are in constant movement is called the kinetic theory of gases. This
theory makes certain assumptions:
the gas molecules move rapidly and randomly
the distance between the gas molecules is much greater than the diameter of the molecules, so the
volume of the molecules is negligible (hardly any volume).
there are no intermolecular forces of attraction or repulsion between the molecules
all collisions between particles are elastic: this means no kinetic energy is lost in collisions (kinetic
energy is the energy associated with moving particles)
the temperature of the gas is related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules.
A theoretical gas that fits this description is called an ideal gas. In reality, the gases you are learning
about don’t fit this description exactly, although they may come very close. We call these gases real
gases.
Noble gases with small atoms, such as helium and neon, come close to ideal gas behaviour. This is because
the intermolecular forces are so small.

Question
2

Explain why the intermolecular forces in a sample of helium and neon are very small.

IMPORTANT
Ideal gases have zero particle volume and no intermolecular forces of attraction.

Ideal gases
The volume that a gas occupies depends on:
its pressure; we measure pressure in pascals, Pa
its temperature; we measure temperatures of gases in kelvin, K.
The kelvin temperature equals the Celsius temperature plus 273. For example, 100 °C is 100 + 273 = 373
K.

Question
3

a

b

Convert the following temperatures into the kelvin temperature:
i

245 °C

ii

−45 °C

How many pascals are there in 15 kPa?

IMPORTANT
The pressure of a gas is due to collisions between the gas molecules and the walls of the container.
Gases in a container exert a pressure. This is because the gas molecules are constantly hitting the walls of
the container. If we decrease the volume of a gas (at constant temperature) the molecules are squashed

closer together and hit the walls of the container more often. So the pressure of the gas increases (Figure
5.3a). A graph of volume of gas plotted against

gives a proportional relationship (as shown by the

straight line in Figure 5.3b). We say that the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure.

Figure 5.3: a As the volume of a gas decreases, at constant temperature, its pressure increases due to the increased
frequency of the gas molecules hitting the walls of the container. b For an ideal gas a plot of the volume of gas against
shows a proportional relationship

IMPORTANT
Two variables are proportional if there is a constant ratio between them. Look at the figures for
temperature and gas volume in the table below:
Temperature / K

136.5

273

546

Gas volume / dm3

11.2

22.4

44.8

Table 5.1: Data table showing temperature against gas volume.

When a gas is heated at constant pressure its volume increases (Figure 5.4a). This is because the particles
move faster and hit the walls of the container with greater force. For the pressure to be constant, the
molecules must get further apart. The volume of a gas at constant pressure is proportional to its
temperature measured in kelvin (Figure 5.4b).

Figure 5.4: a As the temperature increases, at constant pressure, the volume of a gas increases. Molecules hit the walls
with increased force. b For an ideal gas, the volume of a gas is proportional to its kelvin temperature.

An ideal gas will have a volume that varies exactly in proportion to its temperature and exactly in inverse
proportion to its pressure.

Question
4

Some chemical reactions involving gases are performed in sealed glass tubes that do not melt at high
temperatures. If the tubes have walls that are too thin, the tubes can easily break. Use the kinetic
theory of gases to explain why these tubes should not be heated to high temperatures.

Limitations of the ideal gas laws
Scientists have taken accurate measurements to show how the volumes of gases change with temperature
and pressure. These show us that gases do not always behave exactly as we expect an ideal gas to
behave. This is because real gases do not always obey the kinetic theory in two ways:
there is not zero attraction between the molecules
we cannot ignore the volume of the molecules themselves.
These differences are especially noticeable at very high pressures and very low temperatures. Under these
conditions:
the molecules are close to each other
the volume of the molecules is not negligible compared with the volume of the container
there are instantaneous dipole−induced dipole forces or permanent dipole−permanent dipole forces of
attraction between the molecules
attractive forces pull the molecules towards each other and away from the walls of the container
the pressure is lower than expected for an ideal gas
the effective volume of the gas is smaller than expected for an ideal gas.

Question
5

a

What is meant by the term ideal gas?

b

Under what conditions do real gases differ from ideal gases? Explain your answer.

The general gas equation
IMPORTANT
The ideal gas equation pV = nRT shows the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature and
number of moles of gas. Make sure that you can rearrange this equation to make any of these values
the subject of the expression, e.g.

For an ideal gas, we can combine the laws about how the volume of a gas depends on temperature and
pressure. We also know from Section 3.8 that the volume of a gas is proportional to the number of moles
present. Putting all these together, gives us the ideal gas equation:
pV = nRT
p is the pressure in pascals, Pa
V is the volume of gas in cubic metres, m3 (1 m3 = 1000 dm3)
n is the number of moles of gas
R is the gas constant, which has a value of 8.31 J K−1 mol−1
T is the temperature in kelvin, K.

Calculations using the general gas equation
If we know any four of the five physical quantities in the general gas equation, we can calculate the fifth.

IMPORTANT
To change °C to kelvin, add 273 to the Celsius (°C) temperature.
A pressure of 101 325 pascals = 1.0 atmosphere pressure.

WORKED EXAMPLES
1

Calculate the volume occupied by 0.500 mol of carbon dioxide at a pressure of 150 kPa and a
temperature of 19 °C.
(R = 8.31 J K−1 mol−1)

Solution
Step 1:

Change pressure and temperature to their correct units:
150 kPa = 150 000 Pa;
19 °C = 19 + 273 = 292 K

Step 2:

Rearrange the general gas equation to the form you need:
pV = nRT

Step 3:

so

V=

Substitute the figures:
V =
=
= 8.09 × 10−3 m3
= 8.09 dm3

2

A flask of volume 5.00 dm3 contained 4.00 g of oxygen.
Calculate the pressure exerted by the gas at a temperature of 127 °C.
(R = 8.31 J K−1 mol−1; Mr oxygen = 32.0)

Solution
Step 1:

Change temperature and volume to their correct units and calculate the number of
moles of oxygen.
127 °C = 127 + 273 = 400 K
5 dm3 =

m3 = 5.00 × 10−3 m3

n =
=
= 0.125 mol
Step 2:

Rearrange the general gas equation to the form you need:
pV = nRT

Step 3:

so

p=

Substitute the figures:
p=
p=
p = 8.31 × 104 Pa

Note:
If you are given the pressure in kPa and the volume in dm3, you can insert these figures directly into
the equation without having to convert into Pa and m3. This is because by changing kPa to Pa you
are multiplying by 1000 and by changing dm3 to m3 you are dividing by 1000. Because p and V are

on the same side of the equation pV = nRT, the × 1000 and ÷ 1000 cancel each other.

IMPORTANT
Remember that if you substitute the pressure in kPa in the equation pV = nRT, the volume of gas
calculated will be in dm3. If you substitute the pressure in Pa in the equation pV = nRT, the volume of
gas calculated will be in m3.

Calculating relative molecular masses
An accurate method of finding the relative molecular mass of a substance is to use a mass spectrometer
(see Chapter 3).
A less accurate method, but one that is suitable for a school laboratory, is to use the general gas equation
to find the mass of gas in a large flask. As the number of moles is the mass of a substance divided by its
relative molecular mass, we can find the relative molecular mass of a gas by simply substituting in the
general gas equation. Although weighing gases is a difficult process because they are so light and you
have to consider the buoyancy of the air, the method can give reasonable results.
You can apply this method to find the relative molecular mass of a volatile liquid. The volatile liquid is
injected into a gas syringe placed in a syringe oven (Figure 5.5). The liquid vaporises and the volume of the
vapour is recorded.

WORKED EXAMPLE
3

A flask of volume 2.00 dm3 was found to contain 5.28 g of a gas. The pressure in the flask was 200
kPa and the temperature was 20 °C. Calculate the relative molecular mass of the gas.
(R = 8.31 J K−1 mol−1)

Solution
Step 1:

Change pressure, temperature and volume to their correct units.
200 kPa = 2.00 × 105 Pa
20 °C = 20 + 273 = 293 K
2.00 dm3 =

Step 2:

m3 = 2.00 × 10−3 m3

Rearrange the general gas equation to the form you need:
pV = nRT and n =
so pV =

RT,

which gives Mr =
Step 3:

Substitute the figures:
Mr =

=

= 32.14
= 32 g mol−1

Question

a

Calculate the volume occupied by 272 g of methane at a pressure of 250 kPa and a temperature
of 54 °C. (R = 8.31 J K−1 mol−1; Mr methane = 16.0)

temperature in the flask in kelvin.

5.3 The liquid state
The behaviour of liquids
When we heat a solid:
the energy transferred to the solid makes the particles vibrate more vigorously
the forces of attraction between the particles weaken
the solid changes to a liquid at its melting point.

IMPORTANT
The melting point of a solid is the temperature at which it changes to a liquid at 1 atmosphere
pressure.
We call this change of state melting.
For ionic compounds, we need a high temperature to melt the substance because ionic bonding is very
strong. For molecular solids, we need a lower temperature, just enough to overcome the weak
intermolecular forces between the particles.
The particles in a liquid are still close to each other but they have enough kinetic energy to keep sliding
past each other in a fairly random way. They do not move freely as gas particles do. For brief periods, the
particles in liquids are arranged in a slightly ordered way. But this order is always being broken up when
the particles gain kinetic energy from neighbouring particles.
When we cool a liquid, the particles:
lose kinetic energy so they do not move around so readily
experience increasing forces of attraction
stop sliding past each other when the temperature is sufficiently low; the liquid solidifies.
We call this change of state freezing.

Vaporisation and vapour pressure
When we heat a liquid:
the energy transferred to the liquid makes the particles move faster
the forces of attraction between the particles weaken
the particles with most energy are the first to escape from the forces holding them together in the
liquid
the liquid evaporates: this happens at a temperature below the boiling point
the forces weaken enough for all the particles to become completely free from each other; they move
fast and randomly and they spread out
the liquid boils; this happens at the boiling point.
This change from the liquid state to the gas state is called vaporisation. The energy required to change
one mole of liquid to one mole of gas is called the enthalpy change of vaporisation.
When we cool a vapour, the particles:
lose kinetic energy so the molecules move around less quickly
experience increasing forces of attraction
move more slowly and become closer together when the temperature is sufficiently low; the gas
liquefies.
We call this change of state condensation.

These changes in state are reversible. Water can be boiled to form steam, and steam can be condensed to
form liquid water. These changes involve opposite energy transfers. For example: energy has to be
transferred to water to boil it to form steam. But when steam condenses to form water, energy is
transferred from the steam.
If we put some water in an open beaker, it evaporates until none is left. But what happens when we allow
water to evaporate in a closed container?

Figure 5.6: a Water molecules move from liquid to vapour. b As more molecules move from liquid to vapour, some begin
to move back to the liquid. c An equilibrium is reached with molecules going from liquid to vapour at the same rate as
from vapour to liquid.

At first, water molecules escape from the surface of the liquid to become vapour (Figure 5.6a). As more and
more molecules escape, the molecules in the vapour become closer together. Eventually the molecules
with lower kinetic energy will not be able to overcome the attractive forces of neighbouring molecules. The
vapour begins to condense. So some water molecules return to the liquid (Figure 5.6b). Eventually, water
molecules return to the liquid at the same rate as water molecules escape to the vapour. A position of
equilibrium is reached (Figure 5.6c; see Chapter 8).
At equilibrium the concentration of water molecules in the vapour remains constant.

In this situation the pressure exerted by a vapour in equilibrium with its liquid is called its vapour
pressure. The vapour pressure is caused by the gas particles hitting the walls of the container. Vapour
pressure will increase when the temperature increases because:
the gas particles have more kinetic energy
the gas particles move faster, so they are able to overcome intermolecular forces of attraction more
easily.

IMPORTANT
The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which it changes to a gas at 1 atmosphere (101 325
Pa) pressure. A more exact definition is the temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to the
atmospheric pressure.

Question
9

Bromine is a reddish-brown liquid. Some liquid bromine is placed in a closed jar. The bromine starts to
evaporate. The colour of the vapour above the liquid bromine becomes darker and darker. After a time
the bromine vapour does not get any darker.
Use ideas about moving particles to explain these observations.

5.4 The solid state
Many ionic, metallic and covalent compounds are crystalline. The regular structure of crystals is due to the
regular packing of the particles within the crystal. We call this regularly repeating arrangement of ions,
atoms or molecules a crystal lattice.

Ionic lattices
Ionic lattices have three-dimensional arrangements of alternating positive and negative ions. Compounds
with ionic lattices are sometimes called giant ionic structures.
The type of lattice formed depends on the relative sizes of the ions present. The ionic lattices for sodium
chloride and magnesium oxide are cubic. In sodium chloride, each sodium ion is surrounded by six
oppositely charged chloride ions. The chloride ions are much larger than the sodium ions. The sodium ions
fit into the spaces between the chloride ions so that they are as close as possible to them (Figure 5.7).

Figure 5.7: The arrangement of the ions in sodium chloride: a the actual packing of the ions, b an ‘exploded’ view so that
you can see the arrangement of the ions clearly.

Magnesium oxide has the same lattice structure as sodium chloride. Magnesium ions replace sodium ions
and the oxide ions replace the chloride ions.
The properties of ionic compounds reflect their structure as well as their bonding:
They are hard. It takes a lot of energy to scratch the surface because of the strong attractive forces
keeping the ions together.
They are brittle. Ionic crystals may split apart when hit in the same direction as the layers of ions
(Figure 5.8). The layers of ions may be displaced by the force of the blow so that ions with the same
charge come together. The repulsions between thousands of ions in the layers, all with the same
charge, cause the crystals to split along these cleavage planes.
They have high melting points and high boiling points. This is because the attraction between the large
numbers of oppositely charged ions in the lattice acts in all directions and bonds them strongly
together. The melting points and boiling points increase with the charge density on the ions. So
magnesium oxide, Mg2+O2−, has a higher melting point (2852 °C) than sodium chloride, Na+Cl− (801
°C). This is because there is a greater electrostatic attraction between doubly charged positive and
negative ions than between singly charged ions of similar size.
Many ionic compounds are soluble in water because they can form ion–dipole bonds (see Section
19.4).
They only conduct electricity when molten or in solution (see Section 4.9).

Figure 5.8: Sapphires sparkle in the light when polished. They are cut by exerting a force on the cleavage planes between
layers of ions in the crystal.

Metallic lattices
IMPORTANT
Remember that metals conduct electricity when solid or liquid due to mobile delocalised electrons but
ionic giant structures only conduct when liquid (molten) or when in aqueous solution due to mobile
ions.
In Chapter 4, we learnt that a metallic lattice consists of ions surrounded by a sea of electrons. The ions are
often packed in hexagonal layers or in a cubic arrangement. Figure 5.9 shows part of a lattice of copper
ions arranged in layers. When a force is applied, the layers can slide over each other. But in a metallic
bond, the attractive forces between the metal ions and the delocalised electrons act in all directions. So
when the layers slide, new metallic bonds are easily re-formed between ions in new lattice positions and
the delocalised electrons (Figure 5.11). The delocalised electrons continue to hold the ions in the lattice
together. The metal now has a different shape. This explains why metals are malleable (they can be
hammered into different shapes) and ductile (they can be drawn into wires). The high tensile strength and
hardness of most metals is also due to the strong attractive forces between the metal ions and the
delocalised electrons.

Figure 5.9: Layers of copper ions.

Figure 5.10: You can clearly see the metal crystals or ‘grains’ in this metal plate.

Figure 5.11: When a force is applied to a metallic structure, the layers slide over each other and re-form in new lattice
positions.

Alloys and their properties
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals or a metal with a non-metal. The metal added to create the
alloy becomes part of the crystal lattice of the other metal.
Brass is an alloy of copper (70%) with zinc (30%). It is stronger than copper but still malleable. For these
reasons, it is used for musical instruments, ornaments and household items such as door handles.
But why is brass stronger than pure copper?
Zinc ions are larger than copper ions. The presence of different-sized metal ions makes the arrangement of
the lattice less regular. This stops the layers of ions from sliding over each other so easily when a force is
applied (Figure 5.12).

Figure 5.12: The layers of ions in an alloy slide less easily than in a pure metal because the structure of the lattice is less
regular.

Pure aluminium is softer than many metals. It is ductile and has high electrical and thermal conductivity.
Because of its low strength, pure aluminium is of little use in engineering. But its strength can be increased
by adding other elements such as copper, magnesium, silicon and manganese. Many alloys of aluminium
are lightweight, strong and resistant to corrosion. These are used for the bodies of aircraft, for the cylinder
blocks of car engines and for bicycle frames, all situations where low density combined with strength and
corrosion resistance is important.
Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. A 33-metre high bronze statue was built near the harbour in Rhodes
(Greece) over 2000 years ago. The statue fell down after an earthquake and was eventually bought by a
Syrian merchant. The bronze was recycled to make useful implements.

Question
10 Explain the following:
a

why are most metals strong, but ionic solids are brittle?

b

why is an alloy of copper and tin stronger than either copper or tin alone?

Simple molecular lattices
Substances with a simple molecular structure, such as iodine, can also form crystals (Figure 5.13). This
reflects the regular packing of the molecules in a lattice structure.

Figure 5.13: Iodine molecules are arranged in a lattice structure.

Ice also forms a crystalline lattice. Ice and water have peculiar properties because of hydrogen bonding
(see Section 4.8).
The distance between the nuclei of neighbouring iodine molecules is greater than the distance between the
nuclei within the iodine molecule. This is because the forces between the molecules are weak
intermolecular forces, whereas the forces between the atoms within the molecule are strong covalent
bonds. Very little energy is needed to overcome the weak intermolecular forces between the molecules.
The lattice is easily broken down when iodine crystals are heated, so iodine has a low melting point.

Giant molecular structures
IMPORTANT
GIANT STRUCTURE: Most giant structures have a network of either covalent bonds (molecular giant
structure), metallic bonds (metallic giant structure) or ionic bonds (ionic giant structure). The network
of strong bonds is hard to break and so the melting and boiling points of these structures are generally
very high.
Some covalently bonded structures have a three-dimensional network of covalent bonds throughout the
whole structure. We call these structures giant molecular structures or giant covalent structures.
They have high melting and boiling points because of the large number of strong covalent bonds linking
the whole structure. Elements such as carbon (graphite and diamond), and compounds such as silicon
dioxide, can be giant molecular structures. Diamond and graphite are different forms of the same element.
Different crystalline or molecular forms of the same element are called allotropes.

IMPORTANT

Allotropes are different crystalline forms of the same element. The term only applies to solids.
Diamond, graphite and buckminsterfullerene are allotropes of carbon.

Graphite
In graphite, the carbon atoms are arranged in planar layers. Within the layers, the carbon atoms are
arranged in hexagons. Each carbon atom is joined to three other carbon atoms by strong covalent bonds
(Figure 5.14). The fourth electron of each carbon atom occupies a p orbital. These p orbitals on every
carbon atom in each planar layer overlap sideways. A cloud of delocalised electrons is formed above and
below the plane of the carbon rings. These electron clouds join up to form extended delocalised rings of
electrons.
The layers of carbon atoms are kept next to each other by weak instantaneous dipole−induced dipole
forces.
The properties of graphite are related to its structure.
High melting and boiling points: there is strong covalent bonding throughout the layers of carbon
atoms. A lot of energy is needed to overcome these strong bonds.

Figure 5.14: The structure of graphite.

Softness: graphite is easily scratched. The forces between the layers of carbon atoms are weak. The
layers of graphite can slide over each other when a force is applied. The layers readily flake off. This
‘flakiness’ is why graphite is used in pencil ‘leads’ and feels slippery.
Good conductor of electricity: when a voltage is applied, the delocalised electrons (mobile
electrons) can move along the layers.

Diamond
In diamond, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with other carbon atoms (Figure 5.15). The
carbon atoms are positioned around each other in a tetrahedral arrangement. The network of carbon
atoms extends almost unbroken throughout the whole structure. The regular arrangement of the atoms
gives diamond a crystalline structure.

Figure 5.15: The structure of diamond.

The properties of diamond are related to its structure.
High melting and boiling points: there is strong covalent bonding throughout the whole structure.

A lot of energy is needed to break these strong bonds and separate the atoms.
Hardness: diamond cannot be scratched easily because it is difficult to break the three-dimensional
network of strong covalent bonds.
Does not conduct electricity: all of the four outer electrons on every carbon atom are involved in
covalent bonding. This means that there are no free electrons available to carry the electric current.
Most of the diamonds used around the world have been mined from the Earth’s crust. However, artificial
diamonds can be made by heating other forms of carbon under high pressure. Artificial diamonds are too
small to be used for jewellery but they can be used for drill tips.

Silicon(IV) oxide
There are several forms of silicon(IV) oxide. The silicon(IV) oxide found in the mineral quartz (Figure 5.16)
has a structure similar to diamond (Figure 5.17).

Figure 5.16: The shape of these quartz crystals reflects the regular arrangement of the silicon and oxygen atoms.

Figure 5.17: The structure of silicon(IV) oxide.

Each silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms but each oxygen atom is bonded to only two silicon
atoms. So the formula for silicon(IV) oxide is SiO2. Silicon dioxide has properties similar to that of diamond.
It forms hard, colourless crystals with high melting and boiling points and it does not conduct electricity.
Sand is largely silicon(IV) oxide.

IMPORTANT
Remember that most giant molecular structures do not conduct electricity. One exception is graphite.
Most do not conduct heat but diamond is a good conductor of heat.

Questions
12 Explain the following properties of silicon(IV) oxide by referring to its structure and bonding.
a

It has a high melting point.

It does not conduct electricity.

It is a crystalline solid.

C

X is a metal, Y has a simple molecular structure, Z has a giant ionic structure.

D

X has a giant ionic structure, Y has a simple molecular structure, Z is a metal.

IMPORTANT
Remember that not all metals have high melting points. Group 1 metals and mercury have lower
boiling points than some non-metals. So do not use high melting point as a characteristic of metals
unless you are only referring to transition elements. What distinguishes metals from most other
structures is that that they conduct electricity when solid.

5.5 Fullerenes
Graphite and diamond are not the only allotropes of carbon. In recent years, substances called fullerenes
have been made. The structure of many fullerenes is based on rings of carbon atoms, as is the structure of
graphite. But many fullerenes exhibit properties unlike those of graphite. The individual particles in
fullerenes may have one of their dimensions between 0.1 and 100 nanometres (1 nanometre = 10−9 m).
Particles of this size are called nanoparticles. Another form of carbon, graphene, can be regarded as a
single layer of graphite.
Fullerenes are allotropes of carbon in the form of hollow spheres or tubes. They are similar in structure to
graphite, in that each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms. They contain rings of carbon
atoms arranged in hexagons and in addition many contain rings of carbon atoms arranged in pentagons.

Buckminsterfullerene
The first fullerene discovered was called buckminsterfullerene, C60 (Figure 5.18). Buckminsterfullerene
is a simple molecular structure. The C60 molecule has the shape of a football (soccer ball). The carbon
atoms are arranged at the corners of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. The bonds where two hexagons join
are shorter than the bonds between the hexagons and the pentagons. As in graphite, some of the electrons
in C60 are delocalised, but to a lesser extent than in graphite. Since the discovery of the C60 molecule,
many types of buckminsterfullerene have been discovered. Some are ball-shaped molecules that are
multiples of C60, e.g. C120. Other fullerene molecules include C20, C70 and C72.

Figure 5.18: The shape of a buckminsterfullerene molecule, C60, a is similar to that of a football, b.

The properties of buckminsterfullerene are significantly different from those of graphite and diamond.
It has a relatively low sublimation point. It turns directly from the solid to the vapour state when
heated to about 600 °C. (Graphite only turns from the solid to the vapour state at about 3700 °C.) This
is because there are weak intermolecular forces between each buckminsterfullerene molecule and no
continuous layered giant structure as in graphite.
It is relatively soft because it does not require much energy to overcome the weak intermolecular
forces.
It is a poor conductor of electricity compared with graphite because the extent of electron
delocalisation is lower.
It is slightly soluble in solvents such as carbon disulfide and methylbenzene. Neither diamond nor
graphite is soluble in common solvents.
It is more reactive than graphite or diamond. Buckminsterfullerene reacts with hydrogen, fluorine,
chlorine, bromine and oxygen. This is due to the relatively high electron density in certain parts of the
molecule (see electrophilic addition in Section 15.1).

Nanotubes
Note: Nanotubes and graphene are not part of the syllabus, but you may be asked questions about the
structure and related properties of an unfamiliar substance from given information, e.g. a diagram of the

structure.
A second type of fullerene is a class of molecules described as nanotubes. Nanotubes are fullerenes of
hexagonally arranged carbon atoms like a single layer of graphite bent into the form of a cylinder (Figure
5.19). The first nanotubes to be made were one layer of carbon atoms in thickness. More recently,
nanotubes have been made with thicker walls with several tubes inside one another.
Although the diameter of a nanotube is very small, it can be made relatively long. The length of the
nanotube cylinder can be a million times greater than its diameter.

Figure 5.19: Part of the structure of a nanotube. The ends of the cylinder are often closed.

Nanotubes have characteristic properties:
They have high electrical conductivity along the long axis of the cylinder. This is because, like graphite,
some of the electrons are delocalised and are able to move along the cylinder when a voltage is
applied.
They have a very high tensile strength when a force is applied along the long axis of the cylinder. They
can be up to 100 times stronger than steel of the same thickness.
They have very high melting points (typically about 3500 °C). This is because there is strong covalent
bonding throughout the structure.
Fullerenes have a large range of potential uses. Scientists can attach reactive groups to their surfaces and
metal complexes (see Section 24.3) can also be formed. Small molecules or atoms can be trapped in the
cages of buckminsterfullerenes. Possible medical uses include delivering drugs to specific places in the
body. Nanotubes are used in tiny electrical circuits as ‘wires’ and as electrodes in paper-thin batteries. They
can be incorporated into clothing and sports equipment for added strength. They have also been used in
the treatment of certain types of cancer.

Graphene
Graphene is a single isolated layer of graphite (Figure 5.20). The hexagonally arranged sheet of carbon
atoms is not completely rigid and it can be distorted.
Graphene has some of the properties of graphite, but they are more exaggerated. For example:
Graphene is the most chemically reactive form of carbon.
Single sheets of graphene burn at very low temperatures and are much more reactive than graphite.
Graphene is extremely strong for its mass.
For a given amount of material, graphene conducts electricity and heat much better than graphite.

Figure 5.20: a Part of a graphene sheet. b ‘Waves’ in a sheet of graphene.

It has been said that ‘a one square metre hammock made of graphene could support a 4 kg cat but would
weigh only as much as the cat’s whisker’. Potential applications of graphene include use in tiny electrical
circuits and for tiny transistors, touchscreens, solar cells and other energy storage devices.

Question
15 Suggest, using ideas of structure and bonding, why:
a

buckminsterfullerene, C60, is converted from a solid to a gas at a relatively low temperature

b

graphene is a good conductor of electricity

c

buckminsterfullerene, C60, is relatively soft.

SUMMARY
Ideal gases have zero particle volume and no intermolecular forces of attraction.
The volume of a gas under different conditions of temperature and pressure can be calculated using the ideal gas
equation pV = nRT.
The ideal gas equation can be used to determine the relative molecular mass of simple molecules.
Ionic compounds form a giant three-dimensional lattice structure containing ions in a regularly repeating pattern.
The high melting points of ionic substances are due to strong ionic forces acting in all directions between the ions.
The low melting points of simple molecular structures such as iodine are due to weak intermolecular forces between
the molecules.
The high melting points of giant molecular structures such as diamond are due to the large number of strong
covalent bonds arranged in a regularly repeating pattern.

Chapter 6

Enthalpy changes

LEARNING INTENTIONS
In this chapter you will learn how to:

positive) chemical reactions
construct and interpret reaction pathway diagrams in terms of enthalpy changes and activation energy
define and use the term standard conditions
define and use the term enthalpy change with particular reference to enthalpy changes of reaction, formation,
combustion and neutralisation
explain energy transfers during chemical reactions in terms of breaking and making chemical bonds

−mc∆T

carry out calculations using energy cycles to determine enthalpy changes that cannot be found by direct experiment

carry out calculations using bond energy data.

BEFORE YOU START
1

Make a list of reactions that are definitely exothermic and another list of reactions that you know
are endothermic. Explain to another learner how you know that these reactions are either
exothermic or endothermic.

2

Work with another learner to draw a fully labelled reaction pathway diagram (energy profile
diagram) for an endothermic reaction.
Explain to another learner how this diagram shows that the reaction is endothermic.

3

Take it in turns to explain these terms to another learner: bond energy; enthalpy change; activation
energy; standard conditions.

4

Write the displayed formulae (structures showing all atoms and all bonds) of the following: CO2,
H2O, C2H6, NH3, C2H5OH. Check your answers with those in a textbook.

5

Work with another learner to describe how to calculate the energy change in the reaction C2H4 +
3O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O by using bond energies. You can do this in the form of a table if you wish.

ENERGY IN OUR WORLD
Will some countries disappear?
The transfer of energy to or from substances plays a great part in industry and everyday life. At
present, most vehicles, aircraft and power stations depend on the combustion of fossil fuels such as
petrol, kerosene or natural gas. The downside to this is that when fossil fuels are burned, carbon
dioxide is produced. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which, with other greenhouse gases, is
responsible for the enhanced global warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Although the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air is very low, in the last 150 years its
concentration has increased from 280 parts per million parts of air to 400 parts per million. This has
caused the temperature of the Earth’s surface to rise by 0.9 °C over the past 150 years. Most of this
increase has happened in the last 35 years. This has resulted in enough melting of the ice caps in the
Arctic and Antarctic to make the sea level rise by nearly 20 cm. If this carries on at the present rate,
low-lying islands such the Maldives (Figure 6.1) in the Indian Ocean (maximum height 5 m above sea
level) and Vanuatu, Kiribati and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean will disappear under the sea.
Their populations will have to move elsewhere. Low-lying areas in many other countries will also be
affected.
Carbon dioxide also dissolves in the oceans causing the water to become slightly acidic. Acidification
of the oceans has increased by 30% over the last 150 years and is presently increasing by 2 billion
tonnes each year. This is having an effect on organisms such as corals, which are very sensitive to
small changes in pH.
Scientists and engineers have responded to this problem by trying to reduce our dependence on
burning fossil fuels. The rise in the use of solar energy, wind energy and battery-powered vehicles,
however, is slow. So scientists have recently been trying to think of ideas such as capturing and
solidifying carbon dioxide in order to reduce the amount escaping into the atmosphere.

Figure 6.1: The islands of the Maldives may disappear below the sea in the next century if the rate of enhanced
global warming does not decrease.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
As consumers we have a choice of what car to buy or how to heat or cool our homes. How can
individual people help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that is going into the atmosphere?
Why do you think that the governments of many countries are not taking more steps to deal with
enhanced global warming?
The chemical industry is often accused of causing environmental problems. Do you think this is
fair? Or are we too ready to blame others for environmental problems that we are responsible for?

6.1 What are enthalpy changes?
Exothermic or endothermic?
Chemical reactions that transfer heat energy to the surroundings are described as exothermic. In an
exothermic reaction, the temperature of the surroundings increases. For example, when magnesium
reacts with sulfuric acid in a test-tube, the energy released is transferred to the surroundings and the
temperature of the reaction mixture in the tube increases.
Mg(s) + H2SO4(aq) → MgSO4(aq) + H2(g) (energy released)
The surroundings include:
the solvent (in this case water)
the air around the test-tube
the test-tube itself
anything dipping into the test-tube (e.g. a thermometer).
Other examples of exothermic reactions include:
the combustion of fuels
the oxidation of carbohydrates in the bodies of animals and plants (respiration)
the reaction of water with quicklime (calcium oxide) (see Section 11.4).
We describe chemical reactions that absorb heat energy from the surroundings as endothermic. In an
endothermic reaction, the temperature of the surroundings decreases (Figure 6.2). For example, when
sodium hydrogencarbonate reacts with an aqueous solution of citric acid in a test-tube, the temperature of
the reaction mixture in the tube decreases because the citric acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate are
absorbing the heat energy from the solvent, the test-tube and the air.

Figure 6.2: Using a cooling pack to treat a sports injury. When you rub or press the pack, water and ammonium chloride
crystals mix. As the crystals dissolve, energy is transferred from the surroundings, cooling the injury.

Other examples of endothermic reactions include:
the decomposition of limestone by heating (all thermal decomposition reactions are endothermic)
photosynthesis (in which the energy is supplied by sunlight)
dissolving certain ammonium salts in water

Question

a

the burning of magnesium in air

b

the crystallisation of copper(II) sulfate from a saturated solution

c

the thermal decomposition of magnesium nitrate

d

the fermentation of glucose by yeast

e

the evaporation of sea water.

Enthalpy changes and enthalpy profile diagrams
The energy exchange between a chemical reaction and its surroundings at constant pressure is called the
enthalpy change. Enthalpy is the total energy associated with the materials that react. The symbol for
enthalpy is H. We cannot measure enthalpy, but we can measure an enthalpy change when heat energy is
exchanged with the surroundings. We can write this as:

The symbol Δ is the upper case Greek letter ‘delta’. This symbol is often used to mean a change in a
quantity.
For example, ΔT means a change in temperature and ΔH means the enthalpy change.
The units of enthalpy change are kilojoules per mole (kJ mol−1).
We can draw reaction pathway diagrams (also known as enthalpy profile diagrams) to show enthalpy
changes. The enthalpy of the reactants and products is shown on the y-axis. The x-axis shows the reaction
pathway, with reactants on the left and products on the right. Reaction pathway diagrams usually also
show the activation energy, EA, as a hump (up and down curve) between the reactants and the products.
The activation energy is the minimum energy that colliding particles must possess for a reaction to
happen. Activation energy always has a positive value of ΔH because enough energy has to be absorbed to
increase the kinetic energy of the reactant molecules so that they collide with enough force to break bonds
(see Section 6.5).
For an exothermic reaction, energy is released to the surroundings. So the enthalpy of the reactants must
be greater than the enthalpy of the products. We can see from the reaction pathway diagram for the
combustion of methane (Figure 6.3) that Hproducts − Hreactants is negative.

Figure 6.3: Reaction pathway diagram for the combustion of methane.

We can include this information in the equation for the reaction:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)

ΔH = −890.3 kJ mol−1

The negative sign shows that the reaction is exothermic.
For an endothermic reaction, energy is absorbed from the surroundings by the substances in the reaction.

So the enthalpy of the products must be greater than the enthalpy of the reactants. We can see from the
reaction pathway diagram for the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (Figure 6.4) that Hproducts −
Hreactants is positive.
CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)

ΔH = +572 kJ mol−1

The positive sign shows that the reaction is endothermic.

Figure 6.4: Reaction pathway diagram for the decomposition of calcium carbonate

IMPORTANT
For an exothermic reaction, heat is lost from the reactants. The value of ΔH is negative.
For an endothermic reaction, heat is gained by the reactants. The value of ΔH is positive.
1

When drawing reaction pathway diagrams, remember that the activation energy arrow should start
at the level of the reactants and end at the highest point on the energy hump.

2

When drawing the arrow for ΔH make sure that the arrow points downwards for an exothermic
reaction and upwards for an endothermic reaction.

Question
2

Draw full reaction pathway diagrams including activation energy for:
a

the combustion of sulfur to form sulfur dioxide

b

the endothermic reaction H2O(g) + C(s) → H2(g) + CO(g)

6.2 Standard enthalpy changes
Standard conditions
To make any comparison of enthalpy changes a fair comparison, we must use the same conditions, called
standard conditions. These are:
a pressure of 101 kPa (1.01 × 105 Pa, approximately normal atmospheric pressure)
a temperature of 298 K (25 °C) (add 273 to the Celsius temperature to convert a temperature into
kelvin)
each substance involved in the reaction is in its normal physical state (solid, liquid or gas) at 101 kPa
and 298 K.

The symbol ⦵ is used to indicate that the enthalpy change refers to a reaction carried out under standard
conditions.
The information in the equation:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)

⦵

= −890.3 kJ mol−1

shows us that when one mole of methane gas reacts with two moles of oxygen gas to form one mole of
carbon dioxide gas and two moles of water in the liquid state, the standard enthalpy change is −890.3 kJ
mol−1.

A variety of enthalpy changes
We can describe enthalpy changes according to the type of chemical reaction taking place. For example:
enthalpy change of formation
enthalpy change of combustion
enthalpy change of neutralisation.
In more general cases we can use the term:
enthalpy change of reaction.
⦵

Standard enthalpy change of reaction,

⦵
The standard enthalpy change of reaction,
is the enthalpy change when the amounts of
reactants shown in the stoichiometric equation react to give products under standard conditions. The
reactants and products must be in their standard states.
⦵

The symbol for standard enthalpy change of reaction is
exothermic or endothermic.

. Enthalpy changes of reaction can be

The equation that describes the reaction must be given. For example, the equation:
H2(g) +

O2(g) → H2O(l)

⦵

= −286 kJ mol−1

shows us the enthalpy change when one mole of water is formed from hydrogen and oxygen. In this case,
286 kJ of energy is released.
However, if we write the equation as:
2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l)

⦵

= −572 kJ

two moles of water are formed from hydrogen and oxygen. In this case, 572 kJ of energy is released.

The symbol for standard enthalpy change of formation is

. Enthalpy changes of formation can be

exothermic or endothermic. We write the formula of the compound in square brackets after
when we do calculations involving enthalpy changes. Examples are:
2Fe(s) + 1

⦵

O2(g) → Fe2O3(s)
⦵

C(graphite) + 2S(s) → CS2(l)

⦵

to help us

[Fe2O3(s)] = −824.2 kJ mol−1

[CS2(l)] = +98.7 kJ mol−1

Note that the state symbol for carbon is shown as ‘graphite’. This is because there are several forms of
carbon but the most stable is graphite. We choose the most stable form when writing equations where
enthalpy changes are shown.
By definition, the standard enthalpy change of formation of any element in its standard state is zero.
⦵

Standard enthalpy change of combustion,

The standard enthalpy change of combustion,
is the enthalpy change when one mole of a
substance is burnt in excess oxygen under standard conditions. The reactants and products must be in
their standard states.

The symbol for standard enthalpy change of combustion is

always exothermic. The substances combusted can be either elements or compounds.

[S(s)] = −296.8 kJ mol−1

CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)

⦵

[CH4(g)] = −890.3 kJ mol−1

Note that the first equation can be considered as either the enthalpy change of combustion of sulfur or the
enthalpy change of formation of sulfur dioxide.

Standard enthalpy change of neutralisation,

⦵

⦵
The standard enthalpy change of neutralisation,
is the enthalpy change when one mole of
water is formed by the reaction of an acid with an alkali under standard conditions.

For example:
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)

⦵

= −57.1 kJ mol−1

For any acid–alkali reaction the ionic equation is:
H+(aq) + OH−(aq) → H2O(l)
The other ions in solution (Cl− and Na+) are spectator ions and take no part in the reaction (see Section
3.6).

6.3 Measuring enthalpy changes
We can measure the enthalpy change of some reactions by different techniques.
We can measure the enthalpy change of some reactions by a technique called calorimetry. The apparatus
used is called a calorimeter. A simple calorimeter can be a polystyrene drinking cup (Figure 6.5), a vacuum
flask or a metal can.

Figure 6.5: A polystyrene cup can act as a calorimeter for finding some enthalpy changes.

When carrying out experiments in calorimeters, we use known amounts of reactants and known volumes of
liquids. We also measure the temperature change of the liquid in the calorimeter as the reaction occurs.
The thermometer should be accurate to 0.1 or 0.2 °C.
Calorimetry relies on the fact that it takes 4.18 J of energy to increase the temperature of 1 g of water by 1
°C. The energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of a substance by 1 °C (1 K) is called the specific
heat capacity, c, of the liquid. So, the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J g−1 °C−1.
The energy transferred as heat is given by the relationship:
q = mcΔT
where:
q is the heat transferred, in J
m is the mass of water, in g
c is the specific heat capacity, in J g−1 °C−1
ΔT is the temperature change, in °C
As 1 cm3 of water weighs 1 g, we can substitute volume of water in cm3 of water for mass of water in g in
the equation. Aqueous solutions of acids, alkalis and salts are assumed to be largely water.
With solutions we make the assumptions that:
1 cm3 of solution has a mass of 1 g
the solution has the same specific heat capacity as water.
The heat transferred for a known number of moles of reactants in the calorimeter is given by
q = mcΔT
We can scale this up to get the enthalpy change per mole of defined reactant or product. The relationship
we then use is
ΔH = −mc∆T
Note: A rise in temperature is given a positive sign. So the value of ΔH is negative for an exothermic
reaction. A fall in temperature is given a negative sign. So the value of ΔH is positive for an endothermic
reaction.

IMPORTANT

The energy released in calorimetry experiments for a known number of moles of a specified reactant is
given by q = mcΔT.
When we multiply this up to 1 mole of a stated product or reactant, the equation we use is
ΔH = −mc∆T
The negative sign shows that the reaction is exothermic.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 6.1
The enthalpy change of neutralisation by experiment
SAFETY: Only carry out this activity in the presence of a teacher after safety aspects have been
explained.
We can find the enthalpy change of neutralisation of sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid by
mixing equal volumes of known equimolar concentrations of acid and alkali together in a polystyrene
cup.

Procedure
1

Place 50 cm3 of 1.0 mol dm−3 hydrochloric acid in the cup and record its temperature.

2

Add 50 cm3 of 1.0 mol dm−3 sodium hydroxide (at the same temperature) to the acid in the cup.

3

Stir the reaction mixture with the thermometer and record the highest temperature.

In this experiment most of the heat is transferred to the solution, as the polystyrene cup is a good
insulator. Cooling of the warm solution is not a great problem: the reaction is rapid so the maximum
temperature is reached before much cooling of the warm solution has occurred. However, there are
still heat losses to the air and to the thermometer, which make the result less exothermic than the
data book value of −57.1 kJ mol−1.

Specimen results and calculation
mass of solution = 100 g
(50 cm3 of acid plus 50 cm3 of alkali and assuming that 1.0 cm3 of solution has a mass of 1.0 g)
specific heat capacity = 4.18 J g−1 °C−1
(assuming that the heat capacity of the solution is the same as the heat capacity of water)
starting temperature = 21.3 °C reactant solutions
final temperature

= 27.8 °C product solution

temperature rise

= +6.5 °C

(use the relationship q = mcΔT )
heat energy released = 100 × 4.18 × 6.5 = 2717 J
At the start, the reaction mixture contained 50 cm3 of 1.0 mol dm−3 hydrochloric acid and 50 cm3 of
1.0 mol dm−3 sodium hydroxide. The number of moles of each (and of the water formed) is calculated
using
=
= 0.050 moles
So 2717 J of energy was released by 0.050 moles of acid.
Therefore, for one mole of acid (forming one mole of water) the energy released was

=
⦵

⦵

= 54 340 J mol−1

= −54 kJ mol−1 (to 2 significant figures)

The negative sign shows that the reaction is exothermic.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 6.2
Finding the enthalpy change of combustion of propan-1-ol
SAFETY: Only carry out this activity in the presence of a teacher after safety aspects have been
explained.
We can find the enthalpy change of combustion by burning a known mass of substance and using the
heat released to raise the temperature of a known mass of water. The apparatus used for this consists
of a spirit burner and a metal calorimeter (Figure 6.6).

Figure 6.6: A simple apparatus used to find the enthalpy change of combustion of fuels.

Procedure
Weigh the spirit burner containing propan-1-ol. The cap on the burner must be kept on when the
burner is not lit to avoid evaporation of the fuel.
Pour 100 cm3 (100 g) of water into the calorimeter. For greater accuracy this should be weighed out.
Stir the water and record its temperature with a thermometer reading to at least the nearest 0.1 °C.
Place the spirit burner beneath the calorimeter, remove the cap and light the wick. The length of the
wick should have been previously adjusted so that the material of the wick does not burn and the
flame just touches the bottom of the calorimeter.
Keep stirring the water with the thermometer until there is a temperature rise of about 10 °C. Record
this temperature.
Remove the spirit burner, place the cap on it and reweigh it.
To find the standard enthalpy change of combustion we need to know:
the mass of fuel burnt
the temperature rise of the water
the mass of the water
the relative molecular mass of the fuel (propan-1-ol).

Specimen results and calculation
mass of water in calorimeter

= 100 g

mass of spirit burner and propan-1-ol at start

= 86.27 g

mass of spirit burner and propan-1-ol at end

= 86.06 g

mass of propan-1-ol burnt

= 0.21 g

initial temperature of water

= 20.2 °C

final temperature of water

= 30.9 °C

temperature change of the water

= +10.7 °C

Using the relationship q = mcΔT (mass of water × specific heat capacity of water × temperature
change):
energy released by burning 0.21 g propanol
= −(100 × 4.18 × 10.7) = 4472.6 J
the mass of 1 mole of propan-1-ol, C3H7OH, is 60 g
so for 60 g propan-1-ol the energy released
− 4472.6 ×
⦵

⦵

is

= −1 277 885.7 J mol−1

= −1300 kJ mol−1 (to 2 significant figures)

This is much less than the data book value of −2021 kJ mol−1, mainly due to heat losses to the
surroundings.

6.4 Hess’s law
Conserving energy
The law of conservation of energy states that ‘energy cannot be created or destroyed’. This is also called
the first law of thermodynamics.
The first law of thermodynamics also applies to chemical reactions: the total energy of the chemicals and
their surroundings must remain constant. In 1840, Germain Hess applied the law of conservation of energy
to enthalpy changes.
Hess’s law states that ‘the total enthalpy change in a chemical reaction is independent of the route by
which the chemical reaction takes place as long as the initial and final conditions are the same’. The states
of the reactants and products must also be the same whichever route is followed.

Enthalpy cycles (Energy cycles)

Figure 6.7: The enthalpy change is the same no matter which route is followed.

We can illustrate Hess’s law by drawing enthalpy cycles. These are often called energy cycles or Hess
cycles. In Figure 6.7, the reactants A and B combine directly to form C. This is the direct route.
Two indirect routes are also shown. One other way of changing A + B to C is to convert A + B into different
substances F + G (intermediates), which then combine to form C.
Hess’s law tells us that the enthalpy change of reaction for the direct route is the same as for the indirect
route. It does not matter how many steps there are in the indirect route. We can still use Hess’s law.
We can use Hess’s law to calculate enthalpy changes that cannot be found by experiments using
calorimetry. For example, the enthalpy change of formation of propane cannot be found by direct
experiment because hydrogen does not react with carbon under standard conditions.

IMPORTANT
You may be asked to draw an energy cycle. This is just another way of describing an enthalpy cycle or
Hess cycle. Energy cycle is the more general term.

Figure 6.8: An enthalpy cycle (energy cycle) for calculating an enthalpy change of reaction. The dashed line shows the
indirect (two-step) route.

Enthalpy change of reaction from enthalpy changes of formation
We can calculate the enthalpy change of reaction by using the type of enthalpy cycle (energy cycle) shown
in Figure 6.8.
We use the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants and products to calculate the enthalpy change
of the reaction. We take note of the directions of the arrows to find the one-stage (direct) and two-stage
(indirect) routes. When we use Hess’s law we see that:

So ΔHr = ΔH2 − ΔH1
To calculate the enthalpy change of reaction using this type of enthalpy cycle, we use the following
procedure:
write the balanced equation at the top
draw the cycle with elements at the bottom
draw in all arrows, making sure they go in the correct directions
apply Hess’s law, taking into account the number of moles of each reactant and product.
If there are 3 moles of a product, e.g. 3CO2(g), we must multiply the enthalpy change of formation by 3.
Also remember that the standard enthalpy change of formation of an element in its standard state is zero.

WORKED EXAMPLE

When doing enthalpy cycle (energy cycle) calculations remember that:

the enthalpy change of an element in its normal state is zero

2

you must take into account the number of moles of reactants and products in each part of the
energy cycle.

⦵

Step 1:

[C(graphite)] = −393.5 kJ mol−1

Enthalpy change of formation from enthalpy changes of combustion
We can calculate the enthalpy change of formation of many compounds by using the type of enthalpy cycle
shown in Figure 6.10.
We use the enthalpy changes of combustion of the reactants and products to calculate the enthalpy
change of formation. When we take note of the direction of the arrows to find the one-stage (direct) and
two-stage (indirect) routes and use Hess’s law we see that:

So ΔHf = ΔH1 − ΔH2
To calculate the enthalpy change of formation using this type of cycle:
write the equation for enthalpy change of formation at the top; add oxygen on both sides of the
equation to balance the combustion reactions
draw the cycle with the combustion products at the bottom
draw in all arrows, making sure they go in the correct directions
apply Hess’s law, taking into account the number of moles of each reactant and product.

6.5 Bond energies and enthalpy changes
IMPORTANT
Remember that bond breaking is endothermic and bond making is exothermic.

Bond breaking and bond making
Enthalpy changes are due to the breaking and forming of bonds. Breaking bonds requires energy. The
energy is needed to overcome the attractive forces joining the atoms together. Energy is released when
new bonds are formed. Bond breaking is endothermic and bond forming is exothermic.
In a chemical reaction:
if the energy needed to break bonds is less than the energy released when new bonds are formed, the
reaction will release energy and is exothermic.
if the energy needed to break bonds is more than the energy released when new bonds are formed,
the reaction will absorb energy and is endothermic.
We can draw reaction pathway diagrams to show these changes (Figure 6.12). In reality, not all the bonds
in a compound are broken and then re-formed during a reaction. In most reactions only some of the bonds
in the reactants are broken and then new bonds are formed in a specific sequence.

Bond energy
The amount of energy needed to break a specific covalent bond is called the bond dissociation energy. We
sometimes call this the exact bond energy or bond enthalpy.

Figure 6.12: a An energy level diagram showing bond breaking and bond forming for the combustion of methane
(exothermic). b An energy level diagram showing bond breaking and bond forming for the decomposition of hydrogen
bromide (endothermic).

The symbol for bond energy is E. We put the type of bond broken in brackets after the symbol.
So E(C─H) refers to the bond energy of a mole of single bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms.
The bond energy for double and triple bonds refers to a mole of double or triple bonds. Two examples of
equations relating to bond energies are:
Br2(g) → 2Br(g)

E(Br─Br) = +193 kJ mol−1

O═O(g) → 2O(g)

E(O═O) = +498 kJ mol−1

The values of bond energies are always positive (endothermic) because they refer to bonds being broken.
When new bonds are formed the amount of energy released is the same as the amount of energy absorbed
when the same type of bond is broken. So, for the formation of oxygen molecules from oxygen atoms:

2O(g) → O2(g)

E(O═O) = −498 kJ mol−1

Average bond energy
Bond energy is affected by other atoms in the molecule. The O─H bond in water has a slightly different
bond energy value to the O─H bond in ethanol. In ethanol, the oxygen is connected to a carbon atom
rather than another hydrogen atom. We call these bond energies exact bond energies. The O─H bond is in
a different environment. Identical bonds in molecules with two (or more) types of bond have different bond
energies when we measure them. It takes more energy to break the first O─H bond in water than to break
the second. For these reasons we use average bond energies taken from a number of bonds of the same
type but in different environments.
We cannot usually find the value of bond energies directly, so we have to use an enthalpy cycle. The
average bond energy of the C─H bond in methane can be found using the enthalpy changes of
atomisation of carbon and hydrogen and the enthalpy change of combustion or formation of methane.

IMPORTANT
⦵
The standard enthalpy change of atomisation,
, is the enthalpy change when one mole of
⦵
gaseous atoms is formed from its element under standard conditions. So,
[H2] relates to the

equation

H2(g) → H(g)

Figure 6.13: An enthalpy cycle to find the average bond energy of the C─H bond. The dashed line shows the two-step
route.

The enthalpy cycle for calculating the average C─H bond energy is shown in Figure 6.13. Using the
enthalpy cycle shown in Figure 6.13, the average C─H bond energy can be found by dividing the value of
ΔH on the diagram by four (because there are four C─H bonds in a molecule of methane).

Question
11 Use the information in Figure 6.13 and the information below to demonstrate that the average bond
energy of the C─H bond is 415.9 kJ mol−1.

[CH4] = −74.8 kJ mol

⦵

[ H] = +218 kJ mol−1

⦵

[C(graphite)] = +716.7 kJ mol−1

6.6 Calculating enthalpy changes using bond
energies
We can use bond energies to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction that we cannot measure directly.
For example, the reaction for the Haber process (see Section 8.5):
N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)
The enthalpy cycle for this reaction is shown in Figure 6.14. The relevant bond energies are:
E(N≡N) = 945 kJ mol−1
E(H─H) = 436 kJ mol−1
E(N─H) = 391 kJ mol−1

Figure 6.14: The enthalpy cycle for ammonia synthesis. The dashed line shows the two-step route.

It is often easier to set out the calculation as a balance sheet, as shown below:
Bonds broken ΔH1 (kJ)

Bonds formed ΔH2 (kJ)

1 × N≡N = 1 × 945 = 945
3 × H─H − 3 × 436 = 1308

6 × N─H = 6 × 391

total = +2253

total = −2346

Note in these calculations that:
one triple bond in nitrogen is broken
three single bonds in hydrogen are broken
six single N─H bonds in hydrogen are formed (because each of the two ammonia molecules has three
N─H bonds)
values for bond breaking are positive, as these are endothermic, and values for bond forming are
negative, as these are exothermic.
From the enthalpy cycle in Figure 6.14:
ΔHr = ΔH1 + ΔH2
ΔHr = enthalpy change for bonds broken
+ enthalpy change for bonds formed
ΔHr = 2253 + (−2346) = −93 kJ mol−1

REFLECTION
1

Work with another learner to make a list of differences between the definitions of the standard
enthalpy changes of formation, reaction, combustion and neutralisation as well as any differences
in the way that you draw the energy cycle diagrams.

2

Work with another learner to describe the sequence of operations in one of the experiments that
appear in this chapter, e.g. deducing enthalpy change of combustion or deducing the enthalpy
change of reaction. Think about what you would need to measure and the variables you would
need to control. What equations would you need to use when processing the results? What would
you change if you had to do this again?

SUMMARY
Exothermic enthalpy changes have negative ∆H values. Endothermic enthalpy changes have positive ∆H values.
Enthalpy changes can be calculated experimentally using the relationship:
enthalpy change, q = mass of liquid × specific heat capacity × temperature change.
For a mole of defined substance this is written ΔH = −mc∆T
Standard enthalpy change of formation relates to the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed
from its elements under standard conditions. Similar definitions can be written for standard enthalpy changes of
combustion and reaction.
Hess’s law can be used to calculate enthalpy changes for reactions that do not occur directly or cannot be found by
experiment.
Bond breaking is endothermic; bond making is exothermic.
Average bond energies are often used because the strength of a bond between two particular types of atom is
slightly different in different compounds.

Chapter 7

Redox reactions

LEARNING INTENTIONS
In this chapter you will learn how to:
calculate oxidation numbers of elements in compounds and ions
explain and use the terms redox, oxidation, reduction and disproportionation in terms of electron transfer and
changes in oxidation number
explain and use the terms oxidising agent and reducing agent
use changes in oxidation numbers to help balance chemical equations
use Roman numerals to indicate the degree of oxidation or reduction of an element in a compound.

BEFORE YOU START
1

Write down as many definitions of oxidation and reduction as you can. Compare your definitions
with other learners. Were there any definitions that you left out? Discuss with another learner
which definitions of oxidations and reduction are generally most useful.

2

Get another learner to select an oxidation−reduction (redox) equation from a textbook. Explain to

the other learner how you know which compound or element has been oxidised and which has
been reduced. Then reverse the process: you choose and the other learner explains.
3

Make a list of oxidising agents and reducing agents. Compare your list with others in the class.
Were there any obvious ones that you missed out?

4

Do you know any qualitative tests for oxidising agents and reducing agents? Write them down and
compare your ideas with the rest of the class. Check in a textbook to confirm the tests.

5

Take turns in challenging a partner to balance some of the equations from Chapter 3 in this
coursebook. Your partner looks in the book for an equation then writes the equation down without
the large numbers in front of each element or compound. You then try to balance the equation.
How well did you do? Take turns in doing this until you are sure that you can balance these
equations.

6

Now try a similar thing to the challenge directly above but select ionic equations.

7

Write down a list of compounds that include oxidation numbers as roman numerals, e.g. (II), (IV).
Compare your list with the others in the class.

SELF-DARKENING LENSES

Figure 7.1: These photochromic lenses darken in strong light.

Glass has an open network structure of covalently bonded silicon and oxygen atoms. If we add a very
small amount of silver chloride and copper(I) chloride to the glass, we can alter its properties so that it
remains transparent in weak light but darkens in strong light. This photochromic glass can be used to
make spectacle lenses that get darker and darker when more and more ultraviolet light is absorbed
(Figure 7.1). The silver chloride and copper(I) chloride are present at such a low concentration that the
glass is transparent to light.
When the light is strong, the ultraviolet radiation causes a redox reaction between the silver ions and
the copper(I) ions.
Ag+(s) + Cu+(s) → Ag(s) + Cu2+(s)
The silver produced reflects the light from the glass so less light is transmitted and the lenses darken.
Less ultraviolet light gets to the eyes. This is important because too much ultraviolet light has been
linked to damage to the retina of the eye, cataracts (cloudiness of the lens of the eye) and skin cancer.
When we move back into the shade, the copper(II) ions oxidise the silver back to silver ions and the
lenses become transparent again. The darkening process in bright light takes less than one minute but
the reverse process takes from 2−5 minutes. The speed of this redox reaction depends on the
temperature. At very high temperatures the glasses darken more quickly but do not achieve the full
protection of ordinary sunglasses. At very low temperatures the lenses darken more slowly but
become relatively darker. However, they take a longer time to go clear again.
More recently, photochromic plastic lenses have been introduced that depend on the change in
structure of complex molecules instead of redox reactions.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:

What are the advantages and disadvantages of photochromic lenses made of glass compared with
sunglasses?
Give some the advantages and disadvantages of using photochromic glasses

7.1 What is a redox reaction?
A simple definition of oxidation is ‘gain of oxygen by an element’. For example, when magnesium reacts
with oxygen, the magnesium combines with oxygen to form magnesium oxide. Magnesium has been
oxidised.
2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)
A simple definition of reduction is ‘loss of oxygen’. When copper(II) oxide reacts with hydrogen, this is the
equation for the reaction:
CuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(l)
Copper(II) oxide loses its oxygen. Copper(II) oxide has been reduced.
But if we look carefully at the copper oxide / hydrogen equation, we can see that oxidation is also taking
place. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen to form water. The hydrogen has been oxidised. We can see that
reduction and oxidation have taken place together.
Oxidation Is Loss of electrons.
Reduction Is Gain of electrons.
The initial letters shown in bold capitals spell OIL RIG. This may help you to remember these two
definitions!
Oxidation and reduction always take place together. We call the reactions in which this happens redox
reactions. Redox reactions are very important. For example, one redox reaction − photosynthesis −
provides food for the entire planet, and another one − respiration − keeps you alive.
We can also define reduction as addition of hydrogen to a compound and oxidation as removal of hydrogen
from a compound. This is often seen in the reaction of organic compounds (see Chapter 14).
There are two other ways of finding out whether or not a substance has been oxidised or reduced during a
chemical reaction:
electron transfer
changes in oxidation number.

Question
1

a

b

In each of the following equations, state which reactant has been oxidised:
i

PbO + H2 → Pb + H2O

ii

CO + Ag2O → 2Ag + CO2

iii

2Mg + CO2 → 2MgO + C

In each of the following equations, state which reactant has been reduced:
i

5CO + I2O2 → 5CO2 + I2

ii

2H2S + SO2 → 3S + 2H2O

iii

CH2═CH2 + H2 → CH3CH3

Redox and electron transfer
Half-equations
We can extend our definition of redox to include reactions involving ions.
Sodium reacts with chlorine to form the ionic compound sodium chloride.

2Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2NaCl(s)
We can divide this reaction into two separate equations, one showing oxidation and the other showing
reduction. We call these half-equations.
When sodium reacts with chlorine:
Each sodium atom loses one electron from its outer shell. Oxidation is loss of electrons (OIL). The
sodium atoms have been oxidised.
Na → Na+ + e−
This half-equation shows that sodium is oxidised.
We could also write this half-equation as:
Na − e− → Na+
Each chlorine atom gains one electron to complete its outer shell. Reduction is gain of electrons (RIG).
The chlorine atoms have been reduced.
Cl2 + 2e− → 2Cl−
This half-equation shows chlorine being reduced. There are two chlorine atoms in a chlorine molecule,
so two electrons are gained.
In another example, iron reacts with copper(II) ions, Cu2+, in solution to form iron(II) ions, Fe2+, and copper.
Fe(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Fe2+(aq) + Cu(s)
Each iron atom loses two electrons to form an Fe2+ ion. The iron atoms have been oxidised.
Fe → Fe2+ + 2e−
We could also write this half-equation as:
Fe − 2e− → Fe2+
Each copper(II) ion gains two electrons. The copper ions have been reduced.
Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu

Balancing half-equations
We can construct a balanced ionic equation from two half-equations by balancing the numbers of electrons
lost and gained and then adding the two half-equations together. The numbers of electrons lost and gained
in a redox reaction must be equal.

WORKED EXAMPLES
1

Construct the balanced ionic equation for the reaction between nickel and iron(III) ions, Fe3+, from
the half-equations:

Solution
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e−
Fe3+(aq) + e− → Fe2+(aq)
Each Ni atom loses two electrons when it is oxidised. Each Fe3+ ion gains one electron when it is
reduced.
So two Fe3+ ions are needed to gain the two electrons lost when each Ni2+ ion is formed
2Fe3+(aq) + 2e− → 2Fe2+(aq)
Ni(s) → Ni2+(aq) + 2e−
The balanced ionic equation is:
Ni(s) + 2Fe3+(aq) → Ni2+(aq) + 2Fe2+(aq)
Note how the electrons have cancelled out.
2

Construct the balanced ionic equation for the reaction of iodide ions (I−) with manganate(VII) ions

(MnO4−) in the presence of hydrogen ions (H+). Use the following two half-equations to help you:
2I−(aq) → I2(aq) + 2e−

(i)

MnO−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e− → Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)

(ii)

Solution
When two iodide ions are oxidised, they lose two electrons. Each MnO4− ion gains five electrons
when it is reduced.
So we must multiply equation i by 5 and equation ii by 2 to balance the number of electrons:
10I−(aq) → 5I2(aq) + 10e−
2MnO4−(aq) + 16H+(aq) + 10e− → 2Mn2+(aq) + 8H2O(l)
The balanced ionic equation is:
2MnO4−(aq) + 10I−(aq) + 16H+(aq) →
2Mn2+(aq) + 5I2(aq) + 8H2O

Question
2

a

b

Write two half-equations for the following reactions. For each half-equation state whether
oxidation or reduction is occurring.
i

Cl2 + 2I− → I2 + 2Cl−

ii

2Mg + O2 → 2MgO

iii

4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3

Zinc metal reacts with IO3− ions in acidic solution. Construct a balanced ionic equation for this
reaction, using the two half-equations below:
2IO3− + 12H+ + 10e− → I2 + 6H2O
Zn → Zn2+ + 2e−

7.2 Oxidation numbers
What are oxidation numbers?
We can extend our definition of redox even further to include oxidation and reduction in reactions involving
covalent compounds. We do this by using oxidation numbers (oxidation numbers are also called oxidation
states). An oxidation number is a number given to each atom or ion in a compound that shows us its
degree of oxidation. Oxidation numbers can be positive, negative or zero. The + or − sign must always be
included. Higher positive oxidation numbers mean that an atom or ion is more oxidised. Higher negative
oxidation numbers mean that an atom or ion is more reduced. Figure 7.2 shows magnesium (oxidation
number 0) attached to the hull of a ship. It prevents the hull rusting by sacrificial protection when it
releases electrons. During this process, the oxidation number of magnesium changes from 0 (in Mg metal )
to +2 in the Mg2+ ion.

Figure 7.2: This is part of a ship’s hull. It is made of iron protected by bars of magnesium metal. The magnesium atoms
(oxidation number = 0) are oxidised to Mg2+ ions (oxidation number = +2) in preference to iron atoms changing to Fe3+.
This is called sacrificial protection.

Oxidation number rules
IMPORTANT
The more positive (or less negative) the oxidation number, the more oxidised a substance is. The less
positive (or more negative) the oxidation number, the more reduced a substance is. Take care with
negative oxidation numbers: Remember that an ox. no. of −3 is less oxidised / more reduced than an
ox. no. of −2.
We can deduce the oxidation number of any atom or ion by oxidation number rules. It is important to note
that an oxidation number refers to a single atom in a compound.
1 The oxidation number of any uncombined element is zero. For example, the oxidation numbers of each
atom in S8, Cl2 and Zn is zero.
2 In compounds many atoms or ions have fixed oxidation numbers:
Group 1 elements are always +1
Group 2 elements are always +2
fluorine is always −1
hydrogen is +1 (except in metal hydrides such as NaH, where it is −1)
oxygen is −2 (except in peroxides, where it is −1, and in F2O, where it is +2).

3 The oxidation number of an element in a monatomic ion is always the same as the charge. For example,
Cl− is −1, Al3+ is +3.
4 The sum of the oxidation numbers in a compound is zero.
5 The sum of the oxidation numbers in an ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
6 In either a compound or an ion, the more electronegative element is given the negative oxidation
number.

7.3 Applying the oxidation number rules
In the rest of this chapter we shall use ‘ox. no.’ as an abbreviation for oxidation number.

Compounds of a metal with a non-metal
The metal always has the positive ox. no. and the non-metal has the negative ox. no. For example, in
sodium oxide, Na2O, Na = +1 and O = −2.
If we do not know the ox. no. of one of the atoms, we can often work it out using the invariable ox. nos. in
rule 2. For example in sodium sulfide:
ox. no. of each Na atom = +1
for two sodium atoms = +2
Na2S has no overall charge, so the total ox. no. is zero (rule 4)
ox. no. of S = −2

Compounds of a non-metal with a non-metal
In compounds containing two different non-metals, the sign of the ox. no. depends on the electronegativity
of each atom (see Section 10.5). The most electronegative element is given the negative sign (rule 6).

Sulfur dioxide, SO2
ox. no. of each O atom = −2
for two oxygen atoms = 2 × (−2) = −4
SO2 has no charge, so the total ox. no. is zero (rule 4)
ox. no. of S = +4

Iodine trichloride, ICl3
chlorine is more electronegative than iodine, so chlorine is − and iodine is +
ox. no. of each Cl atom = −1
for three chlorine atoms = 3 × (−1) = −3
ICl3 has no charge, so the total ox. no. is zero (rule 4)
ox. no. of I = +3

Hydrazine, N2H4
nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so nitrogen is − and hydrogen is +
ox. no. of each H atom = +1 (rule 2)
for four hydrogen atoms = 4 × (+1) = +4
N2H4 has no charge, so the total ox. no. is zero (rule 4)
ox. no. of two N atoms = −4
ox. no. of each N atom = −2

Compound ions
Compound ions are ions with two or more different atoms. Examples are the sulfate ion, SO42−, and the

nitrate ion, NO3−. We use rule 5 to work out the ox. no. that we do not know.

Nitrate ion, NO3−
ox. no. of each O atom = −2
for three oxygen atoms = 3 × (−2) = −6
NO3− has a charge of 1−, so the total ox. no. of N and O atoms is −1 (rule 5)
ox. no. of the nitrogen atom plus ox. no. of the three oxygen atoms (−6) = −1
ox. no. of N = +5

IMPORTANT
Remember:
1

the oxidation number refers to a single atom or ion in a compound

2

the oxidation number of an element is zero, e,g. for Al, Si, Cl2, P4 ox. no.= 0

3

oxidation numbers are usually whole numbers. In cases where they appear to be fractions it is
because the structure of the compound has not been taken into account.

State the ox. no. of the bold atoms in these compounds or ions:
a

P 2O 5

b

SO42−

c

H 2S

d

Al2Cl6

e

f

ClO2−

g

CaCO3

7.4 Redox and oxidation number
We can define oxidation and reduction in terms of the oxidation number changes of particular atoms during
a reaction:
Oxidation is an increase in oxidation number.
Reduction is a decrease in oxidation number.
Figure 7.3 shows a redox reaction between copper and silver nitrate.

Figure 7.3: Copper reacts with silver nitrate to form silver and copper(II) nitrate. The ox. no. of each copper atom has
increased by two. The ox. no. of each silver ion decreases by one.

When tin reacts with nitric acid, the oxidation numbers of each atom of tin and nitrogen change as shown
below.

Each tin atom (Sn) has increased in ox. no. by +4: tin has been oxidised. Each nitrogen atom has
decreased in ox. no. by −1: nitrogen has been reduced. The ox. no. of each oxygen atom is unchanged at
−2. The ox. no. of each hydrogen atom is unchanged at +1. Oxygen and hydrogen are neither oxidised nor
reduced.
In this reaction, nitric acid is acting as an oxidising agent because it increases the oxidation number of
another atom.
In this reaction, tin is acting as a reducing agent because it decreases the oxidation number of another
atom.

7.5 Oxidising agents and reducing agents
An oxidising agent (oxidant) is a substance which brings about oxidation by removing electrons from
another atom or ion.
An oxidising agent increases the oxidation number of another atom or ion.
When this happens, the oxidation number of the oxidising agent decreases.
Typical oxidising agents are oxygen, chlorine and potassium manganate(VII).
A reducing agent (reductant) is a substance that brings about reduction by donating (giving) electrons
to another atom or ion.
A reducing agent decreases the oxidation number of another atom or ion.
When this happens, the oxidation number of the reducing agent increases.
Typical reducing agents are hydrogen, potassium iodide and reactive metals such as aluminium.
Since oxidation and reduction occur together, in every redox reaction there must be an oxidising agent and
a reducing agent.
For example, in the reaction given by the equation:
MnO4− + 5Fe2+ + 8H+ → Mn2+ + 5Fe3+ + 4H2O
MnO4− is the oxidising agent because the oxidation number of Mn decreases from +7 to +2
MnO4− has increased the oxidation state of iron from +2 to +3
Fe2+ is the reducing agent because the oxidation number of Fe increases from +2 to +3
Fe2+ has decreased the oxidation state of Mn in MnO4− from +7 to +2
The ability of a substance to act as a good oxidising or reducing agent depends on its standard electrode
potential (see Section 20.4). Many substances can act as either oxidising or reducing agents depending on
the substances they are reacting with as well as the conditions.
For example, hydrogen peroxide can act as an oxidising agent or a reducing agent.

iii

As2O3 + 2I2 + 2H2O → As2O5 + 4H+ + 4I−

Identify the oxidising agent and the reducing agent in parts a i and a iii.

7.6 Naming compounds
We sometimes use Roman numbers, in brackets, to name compounds. We use these systematic names to
distinguish different compounds made of the same elements. For example, there are two types of iron
chloride. We show the difference by naming them iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride. The numbers in
brackets are the oxidation numbers of the iron.
In iron(II) chloride, the ox. no. of the iron is +2. The compound contains Fe2+ ions. The formula is FeCl2.
In iron(III) chloride, the ox. no. of the iron is +3. The compound contains Fe3+ ions. The formula is
FeCl3.
We can also use oxidation numbers to distinguish between non-metal atoms in molecules and ions.

Oxides of nitrogen
There are several oxides of nitrogen, including N2O, NO and NO2. We distinguish between these according
to the ox. no. of the nitrogen atom. (The ox. no. of oxygen is generally −2.)
The ox. no. of N in N2O is +1. So this compound is nitrogen(I) oxide.
The ox. no. of N in NO is +2. So this compound is nitrogen(II) oxide.
The ox. no. of N in NO2 is +4. So this compound is nitrogen(IV) oxide.

Nitrate ions
Sodium, nitrogen and oxygen can form two different compounds Na+NO2− and Na+NO3− (Figure 7.4). The
ox. no. of sodium is +1 and the ox. no. of oxygen is −2. So it is the ox. no. of nitrogen that varies.
The ox. no. of N in the NO2− ion is +3. So NaNO is sodium nitrate(III).
The ox. no. of N in the NO3− ion is +5. So NaNO3 is sodium nitrate(V).
Note that the ox. no. comes after the ion it refers to.
The names of ions containing oxygen and one other element end in ‘-ate’ (but hydroxide ions, OH−, are an
exception to this rule). For example, ions containing chlorine and oxygen are chlorates and ions containing
sulfur and oxygen are sulfates.
The names of inorganic acids containing oxygen end in ‘-ic’. The Roman number goes directly after the ion
that contains the oxygen and another element.
H3PO3 is called phosphoric(III) acid because the ox. no. of phosphorus is +3.
HClO4 is called chloric(VII) acid because the ox. no. of chlorine is +7. Salts of the common acids are usually
named without including the ox. no. of the non-metal ion. For example, Mg(NO3)2 is magnesium nitrate not
magnesium nitrate(V), and K2SO4 is potassium sulfate not potassium sulfate(VI). Note also that we do not
state the ox. no. of the metal if it has only one oxidation state.

REFLECTION
Work with another learner to work out the oxidation number of M in oxides with the general formula
MxOy, where x can be any number from 1 to 3 and y can be any number from 1 to 4.
One learner writes the formula for an imaginary oxide using these rules, e.g. M2O4, MO3. Both then
work together to deduce the ox. no. for M.
Don’t worry if the ox. no. comes out as a fraction: this is only for practice at deducing oxidation
numbers!
What resources did you use? Which were the most helpful?

7.7 From name to formula
You can work out the formula of a compound from its name.

WORKED EXAMPLE
3

Each formula unit of sodium chlorate(V) contains one sodium ion. What is the formula of sodium
chlorate(V)?

Solution
We know that:
sodium has an ox. no. of +1
oxygen has an ox. no. of −2
the ox. no. of chlorine is +5
the chlorate(V) ion has a charge of 1− (to balance the 1+ charge of the sodium).
We can work out the formula of the chlorate(V) ion from the oxidation numbers of oxygen and
chlorine (let n be the number of oxygen atoms):
ox. no. (Cl) + ox. no. (O)

= −1

+5 + n × (−2)

= −1

n

=3

So the chlorate(V) ion is ClO3− and sodium chlorate(V) is NaClO3.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 7.1
Demonstrating a redox reaction
SAFETY: Only carry out this activity in the presence of a teacher after safety aspects have been
explained.
We can demonstrate the redox reaction between iron(II) chloride and potassium manganate(VII) using
qualitative chemical tests. Aqueous potassium manganate(VII) is purple in colour. When it reacts with
iron(II) ions in the presence of excess acid it is usually converted to manganese(II) ions, which appear
colourless at low concentrations.

Procedure
You will need three clean test-tubes and separate dropping pipettes for each solution.
1

In the first test-tube, put 1 cm depth of aqueous iron(II) chloride.

2

Using a dropping pipette, add aqueous sodium hydroxide dropwise until you see a definite
change. Record your observations.

3

In the second test-tube, put 1 cm depth of aqueous iron(III) chloride.

4

Using a dropping pipette, add aqueous sodium hydroxide dropwise until you see a definite
change. Record your observations.

5

In the third test-tube, put 2 cm depth of aqueous iron(II) chloride.

6

Using a dropping pipette, add aqueous acidified potassium manganate(VII) to the solution of
iron(II) chloride dropwise until you see a definite colour change. Record your observations.

7

Now add aqueous sodium hydroxide to the contents of this tube until you see a further change.
Record your observations.

Use your results to explain how you know that a redox reaction has taken place. Name the oxidising
agent and the reducing agent.

7.8 Balancing chemical equations using oxidation
numbers
We can use oxidation numbers to balance equations involving redox reactions. This method is especially
useful where compound ions such as nitrate(V) or manganate(VII) are involved.

IMPORTANT
Remember the steps in constructing equations using oxidation numbers:
identify oxidation number changes
balance oxidation number changes
balance charges
balance atoms.

WORKED EXAMPLES
4

Copper(II) oxide (CuO) reacts with ammonia (NH3) to form copper, nitrogen (N2) and water. Deduce
the balanced equation for this reaction.

Solution
Step 1:

Write the unbalanced equation and identify the atoms which change in ox. no.
(shown here in red).

Step 2:

Deduce the ox. no. changes.

Step 3:

Balance the ox. no. changes.

The change in ox. nos. are −2 for the copper and +3 for the nitrogen. To balance
the ox. no. changes, we need to multiply the copper by 3 and the nitrogen in the
ammonia by 2. The total ox. no. changes are then balanced (−6 and +6). Note
that we do not multiply the N2 by 2 because there are already two atoms of
nitrogen present. Once these ratios have been fixed, you must not change them.
Step 4:

Balance the atoms.
There are six hydrogen atoms in the 2NH3 on the left. These are balanced with six
on the right (as 3H2O). This also balances the number of oxygen atoms. The final

equation is:
3CuO + 2NH3 → 3Cu + N2 + 3H2O
5

Manganate(VII) ions (MnO4−) react with Fe2+ ions in the presence of acid (H+) to form Mn2+ ions,
Fe3+ ions and water.
Step 1:

Write the unbalanced equation and identify the atoms that change in ox. no.

Step 2:

Deduce the ox. no. changes.

Step 3:

Balance the ox. no. changes.

MnO4 + 5Fe2+ + H+ → Mn2+ + 5Fe3++ H2O
Step 4:

Balance the charges.
Initially ignore the hydrogen ions, as these will be used to balance the charges.
The total charge on the other reactants is: (1−) (from MnO4−) + (5 × 2+) (from 5Fe2+)
= 9+
The total charge on the products is: (2+) (from Mn2+) + (5 × 3+) (from 5Fe3+) = 17+
To balance the charges we need 8 H+ ions on the left.
MnO4− + 5Fe2+ + 8H+ →
Mn2+ + 5Fe3+ + H2O

Step 5:

Balance the hydrogen atoms in the water.
MnO4− + 5Fe2+ + 8H+ →
Mn2+ + 5Fe3+ + 4H2O

Question
7

Use the oxidation number method to balance these equations.
a

H2SO4 + HI → S + I2 + H2O

b

HBr + H2SO4 → Br2 + SO2 + H2O

c

V3+ + I2 + H2O → VO2+ + I− + H+

7.9 Disproportionation
The element chlorine (Cl2, oxidation number = 0) undergoes a type of redox reaction called
disproportionation when it reacts with alkali. Disproportionation can be thought of as a ‘self-reduction /
oxidation’ reaction. When chlorine reacts with dilute alkali, some chlorine atoms are reduced and some are
oxidised in the same reaction. The actual reaction that takes place depends on the temperature.
When we add chlorine to cold aqueous sodium hydroxide the following disproportionation reaction takes
place:
Cl2(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) +

+ H2O(l)

The ionic equation for this redox reaction can be split into two half-equations, showing the reduction and
oxidation.
The reduction reaction is:
Cl2 + e− → Cl−
ox. no. 0

−1

The change in oxidation number of chlorine is −1
The oxidation reaction is:
Cl2 + 2OH− → ClO− + H2O + e−
ox. no. 0

+1

The change in oxidation number of chlorine is +1
The oxidation numbers are balanced so there are equal numbers of moles of Cl− and ClO− in the equation.

Balancing equations involving disproportionation
When we add chlorine and hot concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide a different disproportionation
reaction takes place. The products are chloride ions, Cl−, chlorate(V) ions, ClO3− and water. Worked
example 6 shows how to balance this disproportionation reaction.

WORKED EXAMPLE
6

Balance the disproportionation reaction which takes place when chlorine is added to hot
concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide. The products are chloride ions, Cl−, chlorate(V) ions, ClO3−
and water.

Solution
Step 1:

Write the unbalanced equation and identify the atoms that change in ox. no.
Cl2 + OH− → Cl− + ClO3− + H2O
ox. no. 0

Step 2:

−1

+5

Deduce the ox. no. changes.
Cl2 → Cl− is −1
Cl2 → ClO3− is +5

Step 3:

Balance the ox. no. changes.
For each ClO3− ion formed we need 5 Cl− to balance.

3Cl2 + OH− → 5Cl− + ClO3− + H2O
Step 4:

Balance the charges.
3Cl2 + 6OH− → 5Cl− + ClO3− + H2O

Step 5:

Balance the chlorine molecules and the water.
3Cl2 + 6OH− → 5Cl− + ClO3− + 3H2O

Question
8

Look at the equation:
Cr2O72− + 2H+ + 3SO2 → 2Cr3+ + H2O + 3SO42−
Which one of these statements about the oxidation number changes is correct?
A

The ox. no. of each Cr atom changes from +12 to +3

B

The ox. no. of each sulfur atom changes from + 4 to +6

C

The ox. no. of each hydrogen atom changes from +1 to 0

D

The ox. no. of each Cr atom changes from +7 to +3

REFLECTION
Work with another learner or group of learners.
Each member of the group looks in this coursebook or another textbook for one or two equations
involving redox reactions. You write the equation down but unbalanced. When you have a number of
equations, try balancing them (using the ox. no. method) by working together as a group. You might
start by selecting the equations that seem easier.
How easy was it to balance these equations? Which steps in the balancing do you need to improve?
Did any of your equations turn out not to be redox equations?

SUMMARY
In a redox reaction, both oxidation (increase in oxidation number) and reduction (decrease in oxidation number) are
taking place.
Redox reactions can be explained in terms of electron loss (oxidation) and electron gain (reduction).
Oxidation numbers are used to name compounds and balance equations.
An oxidising agent brings about oxidation by removing electrons from another atom or ion.
A reducing agent brings about reduction by donating electrons to another atom or ion.

IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY!

Figure 8.1: Ammonia plant in Western Australia.

Millions of tonnes of ammonia are produced throughout the world every year (Figure 8.1). Ammonia is
used to make fertilisers, nitric acid and nylon.
Ammonia is now made using the Haber process, by combining hydrogen and nitrogen in the presence
of a catalyst. The reaction does not go to completion. It reaches equilibrium when the rates of the
forward and backward reactions are equal. The amount of energy needed to run a complex plant for
making ammonia is huge and over the last 100 years, chemists have been working to bring down the
energy costs and reduce pollution.
Before the Haber process was invented, ammonia was produced by the electric arc processes, which
used cheap hydroelectricity but required a temperature of 3000 °C to work. The energy required per
tonne of ammonia formed was 500 gigajoules (1 gigajoule = 109 J). This and the cyanamide process
for making ammonia produced a lot of polluting waste products. The inefficiency of these processes
encouraged the development of the Haber process for the direct synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen
and nitrogen. This has the advantage of producing pure ammonia but high temperatures and
pressures are still needed. The essential part of this process was to find a suitable catalyst. At first,
osmium was used but this was too difficult to obtain. A catalyst of iron-coated iron oxides was then
developed. This reduced the energy requirement for the process to about 90 gigajoules per tonne of
ammonia. But there were still problems, including pollution problems, because of the use of coal to
provide energy and hydrogen. In addition, energy-inefficient electrolysis was used to produce
hydrogen. By 1960, many ammonia plants had switched to natural gas and used petroleum fractions
to produce hydrogen. This increased the energy efficiency of the whole process even more. In modern
ammonia plants, the efficiency has been further increased so that only about 40 gigajoules are needed
to produce a tonne of ammonia. These plants use ruthenium as a catalyst, which decreases the
operating temperature.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Many chemists are trying to develop ‘greener’ manufacturing processes. Use some of the ideas in
the passage above and any other things you can think of to make a list of things that chemists
could do to develop ‘greener’ manufacturing processes.
Chemists have sometimes been blamed for polluting the environment and using up natural
resources. Is this fair?

8.1 Reversible reactions and equilibrium
Reversible reactions
Some reactions can be reversed. For example, when blue, hydrated copper(II) sulfate is heated, it loses its
water of crystallisation and changes to white anhydrous copper(II) sulfate (see Figure 8.2).

This is called the forward reaction.
When water is added to anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, the reaction is reversed.
CuSO4(s) + 5H2O(l) → CuSO4·5H2O(s)
This is called the backward (or reverse) reaction.
We show these two reactions in the same equation by using two half arrows: ⇌
CuSO4∙5H2O(s) ⇌ CuSO4(s) + 5H2O(l)

Figure 8.2: Hydrated copper(II) sulfate (left) and anhydrous copper(II) sulfate (right).

A reaction in which the products can react to re-form the original reactants is called a reversible
reaction. In this case, heating and adding water are not being carried out at the same time. However,
there is a type of chemical reaction in which the forward reaction and the backward reaction take place at
the same time.
In many chemical reactions, the reactants are not used up completely. Some products are formed but the
maximum theoretical yield is not obtained. A mixture of products and reactants is formed. The products
react together to re-form reactants at the same time as the reactants are forming products. This type of
reversible reaction is called an equilibrium reaction. We use the sign ⇌ in equilibrium reactions to show
that they are reversible.
For example, consider the reaction between hydrogen and iodine carried out in a sealed glass tube at 400
°C:
H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)
Molecules of hydrogen iodide are breaking down to hydrogen and iodine at the same rate as hydrogen and
iodine molecules are reacting together to form hydrogen iodide (see Figure 8.3).

Figure 8.3: A snapshot of the dynamic equilibrium between hydrogen gas, iodine gas and hydrogen iodide gas.

When fizzy drinks are made, carbon dioxide gas is dissolved in the drink under pressure. When you take
the lid off a bottle of fizzy drink, bubbles of carbon dioxide suddenly appear. When you put the lid back on,
the bubbles stop. This is because of the equilibrium reaction CO2(g) ⇌ CO2(aq)
The forward reaction happens during manufacture and the backward reaction happens on opening.

Characteristics of equilibrium
An equilibrium reaction has four particular features under constant conditions:
1 it is dynamic
2 the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate
3 the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant at equilibrium
4 it requires a closed system.

It is dynamic
The phrase dynamic equilibrium means that the molecules or ions of reactants and products are
continuously reacting. Reactants are continuously being changed to products and products are
continuously being changed back to reactants.

The forward and backward reactions occur at the same rate
At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the backward reaction. Molecules or ions
of reactants are becoming products, and those in the products are becoming reactants at the same rate.

IMPORTANT
We can get to the equilibrium state by starting from only the reactants or only the products.
At equilibrium, the concentration of products and reactants is constant.
At equilibrium, molecules of reactants are reacting to form molecules of products at the same rate
as molecules of products are reacting to form molecules of reactants.

The concentrations of reactants and products remain constant at equilibrium
The concentrations remain constant because, at equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward
reactions are equal. The equilibrium can be approached from two directions. For example, in the reaction:
H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)
we can start by either:
using a mixture of colourless hydrogen gas and purple iodine vapour, or
using only colourless hydrogen iodide gas.
Figure 8.4 shows what happens when 5.00 × 10−3 mol of hydrogen molecules and 5.00 × 10−3 mol of
iodine molecules react at 500 K in a vessel of volume 1 dm3. As time passes, the purple colour of the iodine
vapour fades until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium the mixture contains 0.68 × 10−3 mol of iodine,
0.68 × 10−3 mol of hydrogen and 8.64 × 10−3 mol of hydrogen iodide.

Figure 8.4: The changes in the concentrations of reagents as 5.00 × 10−3 mol of each of hydrogen and iodine react to
form an equilibrium mixture with hydrogen iodide in a vessel of volume 1 dm3.

Figure 8.5 shows that the same equilibrium can be achieved when 10.00 × 10−3 mol of hydrogen iodide
molecules decompose to iodine and hydrogen. You can see that the same equilibrium concentrations of all
three molecules are achieved.

Figure 8.5: The changes in the concentrations of reagents as 10.00 × 10−3 mol of hydrogen iodide react to form an
equilibrium mixture with hydrogen and iodine gases in a vessel of 1 dm3.

Question
1

These questions relate to the information in Figure 8.5.
a

Why are the concentrations of iodine and hydrogen at equilibrium the same?

b

Describe how the depth of colour of the reaction mixture changes as time progresses.

c

Explain why there must be 8.64 × 10−3 mol of hydrogen iodide molecules in the equilibrium
mixture if 0.68 × 10−3 mol of iodine are present.

Equilibrium requires a closed system
A closed system is one in which none of the reactants or products escapes from the reaction mixture. In an
open system some matter is lost to the surroundings. Figure 8.6 shows the difference between a closed
system and an open system when calcium carbonate is heated at a high temperature in a strong container.
Many chemical reactions can be studied without placing them in closed containers. They can reach
equilibrium in open flasks if the reaction takes place entirely in solution and no gas is lost.

carbon dioxide. b An open system. The calcium carbonate is continually decomposing as the carbon dioxide is lost. The
reaction eventually goes to completion.

happening in terms of changes in concentration of the bromine molecules in the vapour.

8.2 Changing the position of equilibrium
IMPORTANT
Remember that although the concentration of reactants and products are constant at equilibrium,
this does not mean that they are equal to each other.
The position of equilibrium tells us how far the reaction goes to the products or reactants.
If the concentration of products is greater than the concentration of reactants, the position of
equilibrium is to the right (towards the product side).
If the concentration of products is far less than the concentration of reactants, the position of
equilibrium is to the left (towards the reactants side).
Remember that for equilibrium reactions, you always have to refer to the equation written. If you
write it the other way round, the reactants are the products!

Position of equilibrium
The position of equilibrium refers to the relative amounts of products and reactants present in an
equilibrium mixture.
If a system in equilibrium is disturbed (e.g. by a change in temperature) and the concentration of products
increases relative to the reactants, we say that the position of equilibrium has shifted to the right.
If the concentration of products decreases relative to the reactants, we say that the position of equilibrium
has shifted to the left.

Le Chatelier’s principle
Changes in both concentration and temperature affect the position of equilibrium. When any of the
reactants or products are gases, changes in pressure may also affect the position of equilibrium. French
chemist Henri Le Chatelier (1850–1936) observed how these factors affect the position of equilibrium. He
put forward a general rule, known as Le Chatelier’s principle.
If one or more factors that affect a dynamic equilibrium is changed, the position of equilibrium moves to
minimise this change.
We can predict the effect of changing concentration and pressure by referring to the stoichiometric
equation for the reaction. We can predict the effect of changing the temperature by referring to the
enthalpy change of the reaction.

How does change in concentration affect the position of
equilibrium?
When the concentration of one or more of the reactants is increased:
the system is no longer in equilibrium
the position of equilibrium moves to the right to reduce the effect of the increase in concentration of
reactant
more products are formed until equilibrium is restored.
When the concentration of one or more of the products is increased:
the system is no longer in equilibrium
the position of equilibrium moves to the left to reduce the effect of the increase in concentration of
product
more reactants are formed until equilibrium is restored.

For example, look at the reaction:

What happens when we add more ethanol?
The concentration of ethanol is increased.
According to Le Chatelier’s principle, some of the ethanol must be removed to reduce the concentration of
the added ethanol.
The position of equilibrium shifts to the right.
More ethanol reacts with ethanoic acid and more ethyl ethanoate and water are formed.

What happens when we add more water?
The concentration of water is increased.
According to Le Chatelier’s principle, some of the water must be removed to reduce the concentration of
the added water.
The position of equilibrium shifts to the left.
So more water reacts with ethyl ethanoate and more ethanoic acid and ethanol are formed.

What happens when we remove some water?
The concentration of water is decreased.
According to Le Chatelier’s principle, some water must be added to increase its concentration.
The position of equilibrium shifts to the right.
So more ethanoic acid reacts with ethanol and more water and ethyl ethanoate are formed.
A natural effect of how change in concentration affects the position of equilibrium is shown by the
formation of stalactites and stalagmites (Figure 8.7).

Figure 8.7: Stalactites and stalagmites are formed as a result of water passing through rocks containing calcium
carbonate. The solution running through these rocks contains water, dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium

hydrogencarbonate:
CaCO3(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(aq) ⇌ Ca(HCO3)2(aq)
When droplets of this mixture are formed on the roof of the cave, some of the carbon dioxide in the droplets escapes into
the air. The position of equilibrium shifts to the left and calcium carbonate is deposited.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 8.1
An equilibrium involving iodine, acid and alkali
SAFETY: Only carry out this activity in the presence of a teacher after safety aspects have been
explained.
Iodine dissolves in aqueous potassium iodide. We shall call this ‘iodine solution’. Iodine is also soluble
in aqueous sodium hydroxide. In this activity, you will see how you can reverse the reaction by
changing the concentration of acid or alkali.
You will need two test-tubes and three dropping pipettes for this experiment.

Procedure

Using a dropping pipette, put 1 cm depth of ‘iodine solution’ into two separate test-tubes.

To the first test-tube add dilute sulfuric acid (use a fresh dropping pipette). Record any
observations

observations.

Explain what happens to the position of equilibrium when:

The effect of pressure on the position of equilibrium
Change in pressure only affects reactions where gases are reactants or products. The molecules or ions in
solids and liquids are packed closely together and cannot be compressed very easily. In gases, the
molecules are far apart (Figure 8.8).

Figure 8.8: Pressure has a considerable effect on the concentration of gases.

The pressure of a gas is caused by the molecules hitting the walls of the container. Each molecule in a
mixture of gases contributes towards the total pressure. So, at constant temperature, the more gas
molecules there are in a given volume, the higher the pressure.
Figure 8.9 shows what happens when we increase the pressure on the reaction represented by:

In this reaction there are two moles of gas on the left and one on the right. When the pressure is increased
at constant temperature:
the molecules are closer together, because the pressure has increased
the position of equilibrium shifts to minimise this increase
it shifts in the direction of fewer gas molecules (in the direction that opposes the increase in pressure)
more product, Z, is formed from X and Y until equilibrium is re-established.

Figure 8.9: An increase in pressure in this case causes the equilibrium to shift to the right, to produce more molecules of
Z than before, but fewer molecules in the reaction vessel overall.

For example, consider the reaction:
2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g)
There are three moles of gas molecules on the left of the equation and two on the right.

What happens when we increase the pressure?
The molecules are closer together, because the pressure is higher.

According to Le Chatelier’s principle, the reaction must shift in the direction that reduces the number of
molecules of gas.
The position of equilibrium shifts to the right.
So more SO2 reacts with O2 to form SO3.

What happens when we decrease the pressure?
The molecules are further apart, because the pressure is lower.
According to Le Chatelier’s principle, the reaction must shift in the direction that increases the number of
molecules of gas.
The position of equilibrium shifts to the left.
So more SO2 and O2 molecules are formed by the decomposition of SO3 molecules.
Table 8.2 summarises the effect of changes in pressure on two other gas reactions.
Note that:
if there are equal numbers of molecules of gas on each side of the equation, the position of equilibrium
is not affected by a change in pressure.
in a reaction involving gases and solids (or liquids), it is only the molecules of gases that count when
determining how pressure affects the position of equilibrium.

Table 8.3: Effect of temperature on the decomposition of hydrogen iodide.

You can see from Table 8.3 that, as the temperature increases, the concentration of product increases. The
position of equilibrium shifts to the right. We can explain this using Le Chatelier’s principle:
an increase in temperature increases the energy of the surroundings
according to Le Chatelier’s principle, the reaction will go in the direction that opposes the increase in
energy
the reaction will go in the direction in which energy is absorbed, which is the endothermic reaction
the position of equilibrium shifts to the right, producing more H2 and I2.
If an increase of temperature favours an endothermic reaction, a decrease of temperature favours an
exothermic reaction. This means that:
a decrease in temperature decreases the energy of the surroundings
according to Le Chatelier’s principle, the reaction will go in the direction that opposes the decrease in
energy
so the reaction will go in the direction in which energy is released, which is the exothermic reaction.
Table 8.4 summarises the effect of temperature changes on the position of equilibrium for endothermic and
exothermic reactions.

Predict the effect of increasing the temperature on the reaction:
H2(g) + CO2(g) ⇌ H2O(g) + CO(g)
ΔHr = +41.2 kJ mol−1

b

In the reaction
Ag2CO3(s) ⇌ Ag2O(s) + CO2(g)
increasing the temperature increases the amount of carbon dioxide formed at constant pressure.
Is this reaction exothermic or endothermic? Explain your answer.

Do catalysts have any effect on the position of equilibrium?
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. Catalysts reduce the time taken to
reach equilibrium, but they have no effect on the position of equilibrium once this is reached. This is
because they increase the rate of the forward and reverse reactions equally.

IMPORTANT
Remember that:
The equilibrium constant, Kc or Kp, remains the same value even when we change the concentration
or pressure or add a catalyst.

Only change in temperature affects the value of the equilibrium constant Kc or Kp.

8.3 Equilibrium expressions and the equilibrium
constant, Kc
IMPORTANT
Remember square brackets, e.g. [Cl2], are used here to show the concentration of the substance
inside the brackets. Don’t get them muddled with the square brackets used for complex ions (see
Chapter 24).
When writing equilibrium expressions we assume that [X][Y] means [X] × [Y]
If we are being very accurate, we should include the subscript eqm after the square brackets e.g.
[Cl2]eqm but this is usually omitted.

Equilibrium expressions
When hydrogen reacts with iodine in a closed tube at 500 K, the following equilibrium is set up:
H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)
Table 8.5 shows the relationship between the equilibrium concentrations of H2, I2 and HI. The square
brackets in the last column refer to the concentration, in mol dm−3, of the substance inside the brackets.
The results are obtained as follows:
several tubes are set up with different starting concentrations of hydrogen and iodine
the contents of the tubes are allowed to reach equilibrium at 500 K
the concentrations of hydrogen, iodine and hydrogen iodide at equilibrium are determined.
The last column in Table 8.5 shows the number we get by arranging the concentrations of H2, I2 and HI in a
particular way. We get this expression by taking the square of the concentration of hydrogen iodide and
dividing it by the concentrations of hydrogen and iodine at equilibrium. So for the first line of data in Table
8.5:

You can see that this expression gives an approximately constant value close to about 160 whatever the
starting concentrations of H2, I2 and HI.
We call this constant the equilibrium constant, Kc. The subscript ‘c’ refers to the fact that concentrations
have been used in the calculations.
There is a simple relationship that links Kc to the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products and
the stoichiometry of the equation. This is called an equilibrium expression.

IMPORTANT
Remember that the concentrations of products go at the top of an equilibrium expression and the
concentrations of the reactants go at the bottom.
Solids and liquids that appear in the balanced equation are NOT included in the equilibrium
expression.

For a general reaction:
mA + nB ⇌ pC + qD
(where m, n, p and q are the number of moles in the stoichiometric equation)

In equilibrium expressions involving a solid, we ignore the solid. This is because its concentration remains
constant, however much solid is present. For example:
Ag+(aq) + Fe2+(aq) ⇌ Ag(s) + Fe3+(aq)
The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:

What are the units of Kc?
In the equilibrium expression, each figure within a square bracket represents the concentration in mol dm
−3
. The units of Kc therefore depend on the form of the equilibrium expression.

Some examples of equilibrium calculations
WORKED EXAMPLES

In this calculation we are given the number of moles of each of the reactants and products at
equilibrium together with the volume of the reaction mixture.
Ethanol reacts with ethanoic acid to form ethyl ethanoate and water.

500 cm3 of the reaction mixture at equilibrium contained 0.235 mol of ethanoic acid and 0.0350 mol
of ethanol together with 0.182 mol of ethyl ethanoate and 0.182 mol of water. Use this data to
calculate a value of Kc for this reaction.

Solution
Step 1:

Write out the balanced chemical equation with the concentrations beneath each
substance.

Step 2:

Write the equilibrium constant for this reaction in terms of concentration.
Kc =

Step 3:

Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression.
Kc=

= 4.03 (to 3 significant figures)

Step 4:

Add the correct units by referring back to the equilibrium expression:
The units of mol dm−3 cancel, so Kc has no units.
Therefore Kc = 4.03.
Note: If there are equal numbers of moles on the top and bottom of the
equilibrium expression, you can use moles rather than concentration in mol dm−3
in the calculation. In all other cases, if volumes are given, the concentrations must
be calculated before they are substituted into the equilibrium expression.

In this example we are only given the initial concentrations of the reactants and the equilibrium
concentration of the product.
Propanone reacts with hydrogen cyanide as follows:

A mixture of 0.0500 mol dm−3 propanone and 0.0500 mol dm−3 hydrogen cyanide is left to reach
equilibrium at room temperature. At equilibrium the concentration of the product is 0.0233 mol dm
−3
. Calculate Kc for this reaction.

Solution
Step 1:

Write out the balanced chemical equation with all the data underneath:

Step 2:

Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants.
The chemical equation shows that for every mole of product formed, 1 mole of
CH3COCH3 and 1 mole of HCN are consumed. So the equilibrium concentrations
are as follows:
CH3COCH3; 0.0500 − 0.0233 = 0.0267 mol dm−3
HCN; 0.0500 − 0.0233 = 0.0267 mol dm−3

Step 3:

Write the equilibrium constant for this reaction in terms of concentrations:
Kc =

Step 4:

Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression
Kc =

Step 5:

= 32.7 (to 3 significant figures)

Add the correct units by referring back to the equilibrium expression.

So Kc = 32.7 dm3 mol−1

In this example we are given the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the reactants but not the
products.
Ethyl ethanoate is hydrolysed by water:

0.1000 mol of ethyl ethanoate are added to 0.1000 mol of water. A little acid catalyst is added and
the mixture made up to 1 dm3 with an inert solvent. At equilibrium 0.0654 mol of water are present.
Calculate Kc for this reaction.

Solution

Step 1: Write out the balanced chemical equation with all the data underneath.

Step 2: Calculate the unknown concentrations:
the chemical equation shows that 1 mole of CH3COOC2H5 reacts with 1 mole water, so the
equilibrium concentration of CH3COOC2H5 is also 0.0654 mol dm−3 (as we started with the same
initial concentrations of ethyl ethanoate and water)
the amount of water used in forming the products is (0.1000 − 0.0654) = 0.0346 mol dm−3.
The chemical equation shows that 1 mole of water formed 1 mole of ethanoic acid and 1 mole of
ethanol. So the concentrations of both the products at equilibrium is 0.0346 mol dm−3

Step 3: Write the equilibrium constant for this reaction in terms of concentrations:
Kc =
Step 4: Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:
Kc =

= 0.288

(to 3 significant figures)
Step 5: Add the correct units by referring back to the equilibrium expression.

The units of mol dm−3 cancel, so Kc has no units. Therefore Kc = 0.288.

REFLECTION
Work with another learner to draw a spider diagram (mind map) of what you have learned so far about
equilibrium. For example, one arm of your diagram could be equilibrium (in the centre of the diagram)
→ effect of different factors → X, Y, Z.
Another arm could be equilibrium (in the centre of the diagram) → equilibrium expressions → how you
write them / what not to include.
How would you improve your spider diagram?

Kc and concentration changes
If all other conditions remain constant, the value of Kc does not change when the concentration of
reactants or products is altered.
Take the example of the decomposition of hydrogen iodide.
2HI ⇌ H2 + I2
The equilibrium constant at 500 K for this reaction is 6.25 × 10−3.
Kc =

= 6.25 × 10−3

When more hydrogen iodide is added to the equilibrium mixture, the equilibrium is disturbed.
The ratio of concentrations of products to reactants in the equilibrium expression decreases.
To restore equilibrium, both [H2] and [I2] increase and [HI] decreases.
Equilibrium is restored when the values of the concentrations in the equilibrium expression are such that
the value of Kc is once again 6.25 × 10−3.

Kc and pressure changes
Where there are different numbers of gas molecules on each side of a chemical equation, a change in
pressure alters the position of equilibrium. It is shifted in the direction that results in fewer gas molecules
being formed. However, if all other conditions remain constant, the value of Kc does not change when the
pressure is altered.

Kc and temperature changes
We have seen in Section 8.2 that for an endothermic reaction, an increase in temperature shifts the
reaction in the direction of more products.
So for the endothermic reaction:
2HI ⇌ H2 + I2
the concentrations of H2 and I2 increase as the temperature increases

the concentration of HI falls as the temperature increases.
Look at how these changes affect the equilibrium expression:
Kc =
We see that the equilibrium constant must increase with increasing temperature. This is because [H2] and
[I2] are increasing and [HI] is decreasing. Table 8.6 shows how the value of Kc for this reaction changes with
temperature.

Now look at the exothermic reaction:
2SO2 + O2 ⇌ 2SO3
The concentrations of SO2 and O2 increase as the temperature increases.
The concentration of SO3 falls as the temperature increases.
How do these changes affect the equilibrium expression?
Kc =
We see that the equilibrium constant must decrease with increasing temperature. This is because [SO2]
and [O2] are increasing and [SO3] is decreasing.

8.4 Equilibria in gas reactions: the equilibrium
constant, Kp
Partial pressure
For reactions involving mixtures of gases, it is easier to measure the pressure than to measure
concentrations. The total pressure in a mixture of gases is due to each molecule bombarding the walls of
the container. At constant temperature, each gas in the mixture contributes to the total pressure in
proportion to the number of moles present (Figure 8.10). The pressure exerted by any one gas in the
mixture is called its partial pressure.

Figure 8.10: Each gas in this mixture contributes to the pressure in proportion to the number of moles present.

The total pressure of a gas equals the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases.
ptotal = pA + pB + pC …
where pA, pB, pC are the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture.

Equilibrium expressions involving partial pressures
We write equilibrium expressions in terms of partial pressures in a similar way to equilibrium expressions in
terms of concentrations. But there are some differences:
we use p for partial pressure
the reactants and products are written as subscripts after the p
the number of moles of particular reactants or products is written as a power after the p
square brackets are not used
we give the equilibrium constant the symbol Kp (the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures).
For example, the equilibrium expression for the reaction:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)
is written as Kp =

What are the units of Kp?
The units of pressure are pascals, Pa. The units of Kp depend on the form of the equilibrium expression.
Although the standard unit of pressure is the pascal, many chemists in industry use the atmosphere as the
unit of pressure. 1 atmosphere = 1.01 × 105 Pa. Using ‘atmospheres’ as units simplifies calculations
because the numbers used are not as large.

N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)
The pressure exerted by this mixture of hydrogen, nitrogen and ammonia at constant temperature is
2.000 × 107 Pa. Under these conditions, the partial pressure of nitrogen is 1.490 × 107 Pa and the
partial pressure of hydrogen is 0.400 × 107 Pa. Calculate the value of Kp for this reaction.

Solution
Step 1:

Calculate the partial pressure of ammonia. We know that the total pressure is the
sum of the partial pressures.

2.00 × 107 =
(1.49 × 107) + (0.400 × 107) +
Partial pressure of NH3 = 0.110 × 107 Pa
Step 2:

Write the equilibrium expression for the reaction in terms of partial pressures.
K p=

Step 3:

Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression.
Kp =
Kp = 1.27 × 10−15

Step 4:

Add the correct units.
= Pa−2

The units =
Kp = 1.27 × 10−15 Pa−2

Partial pressure and mole fractions
The number of moles of gas is proportional to the volume of the gas at constant temperature. So it follows
that the partial pressure of a gas is proportional to its concentration. The mole fraction of a gas is given
by the relationship:

So the mole fraction of ammonia in a mixture containing 0.5 mol ammonia, 0.9 mol hydrogen and 0.6 mol
of nitrogen is:
= 0.25 (no units)
The partial pressure is related to the mole fraction by the relationship:
partial pressure = mole fraction × total pressure (of all the gases in the mixture)
We can therefore use the number of moles of each reactant and product in a mixture together with the
total pressure to calculate a value for Kp.

IMPORTANT
Note that the sum of the mole fractions should add up to 1.00 and that the sum of the partial
pressures should add up to the total pressure. In Worked example 10 we are using experimental
figures to 3 significant figures but if we kept all the figures to the most accurate possible in our
calculators when doing the working the values should add up correctly.

WORKED EXAMPLE
11 The equilibrium between hydrogen, iodine and hydrogen iodide at 600 K is shown.
H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)
At equilibrium the number of moles present are:
H2 = 1.71 × 10−3, I2 = 2.91 × 10−3, HI = 1.65 × 10−2

The total pressure is 100 kPa.
Calculate the value of Kp for this reaction.

Solution
Step 1:

Calculate the total number of moles
(1.71 × 10−3) + (2.91 × 10−3) + (1.65 × 10−2)
= 2.112 × 10−2

Step 2:

Calculate the mole fraction of each gas

Step 3:

Calculate the partial pressure of each gas
H2 = 0.0810 × 100 = 8.10 kPa
I2 = 0.1378 × 100 = 13.78 kPa
HI = 0.7813 × 100 = 78.13 kPa

8.5 Equilibria and the chemical industry
An understanding of equilibrium is important in the chemical industry. Equilibrium reactions are involved in
some of the stages in the large-scale production of ammonia, sulfuric acid and many other chemicals.

Equilibrium and ammonia production
The synthesis of ammonia is carried out by the Haber process. The equilibrium reaction involved is:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)

ΔHr = −92 kJ mol−1

We can use Le Chatelier’s principle to show how to get the best yield of ammonia. At high temperatures,
when the reaction is faster, the position of equilibrium is to the left because the reaction is exothermic (ΔH
is negative).

What happens if we increase the pressure?
When we increase the pressure, the reaction goes in the direction that results in fewer molecules of gas
being formed.
The equilibrium shifts in the direction that reduces the pressure.
In this case there are four molecules of gas on the left-hand side and two on the right-hand side. So the
equilibrium shifts towards the right.
The yield of ammonia increases.

What happens if we decrease the temperature?
A decrease in temperature decreases the energy of the surroundings.
The reaction will go in the direction in which energy is released.
Energy is released in the exothermic reaction, in which the position of equilibrium favours ammonia
production.
This shifts the position of equilibrium to the right.
The value of Kp increases.

What happens if we remove ammonia by condensing it to a liquid?
We can do this because ammonia has a much higher boiling point than hydrogen and nitrogen.
The position of equilibrium shifts to the right to replace the ammonia that has been removed.
More ammonia is formed from hydrogen and nitrogen to keep the value of Kp constant.

Equilibrium and the production of sulfuric acid
The synthesis of sulfuric acid is carried out by the Contact process. The main equilibrium reaction involved
is:
2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g)

ΔHr = −197 kJ mol−1

We can use Le Chatelier’s principle to show how to get the best yield of sulfur trioxide.

What happens when we increase the pressure?
When we increase the pressure, the reaction goes in the direction that results in fewer molecules of gas
being formed, to reduce the pressure.
There are three molecules of gas on the left-hand side and two on the right-hand side, so the equilibrium
shifts towards the right.

However, in practice, the reaction is carried out at just above atmospheric pressure. This is because the
value of Kp is very high.
The position of equilibrium is far over to the right even at atmospheric pressure. Very high pressure is
unnecessary, and is not used as it is expensive.

What happens if we decrease the temperature?
Decreasing the temperature shifts the position of equilibrium to the right.
A decrease in temperature decreases the energy of the surroundings so the reaction will go in the direction
in which energy is released.
This is the exothermic reaction, in which the position of equilibrium favours SO3 production. The value of Kp
increases.
SO3 is removed by absorbing it in 98% sulfuric acid. The SO3 reacts with the solution and eventually more
H2SO4 is formed. Although the SO3 is absorbed in a continuous process, this does not affect the equilibrium
significantly because the position of equilibrium is already far over to the right.

Question
14 The Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia may operate at a temperature of 450 °C and pressure
of 1.50 × 107 Pa using an iron catalyst.
N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)

ΔHr = −92 kJ mol−1

a

Suggest why a temperature of more than 450 °C is not used even though the rate of reaction
would be faster.

b

Suggest why the reaction is carried out at a high pressure rather than at normal atmospheric
pressure. Explain your answer.

c

Explain why the removal of ammonia as soon as it is formed is an important part of this industrial
process.

d

When the ammonia has been removed, why doesn’t it decompose back to nitrogen and
hydrogen?

8.6 Acid–base equilibria
pH values and neutralisation
pH values
We can use universal indicator or a pH meter to deduce whether a substance is acidic, alkaline or neutral.
acids have pH values below pH 7
alkalis have pH values above pH 7
a neutral solution has a pH value of exactly 7.

Neutralisation
A salt is a compound formed when an acid reacts with a base (or alkali). This type of reaction is called a
neutralisation reaction.
Examples are:

From these equations we can see that:
acid + alkali → salt + water
sodium sulfate and barium chloride are salts
the simplest ionic equation for a neutralisation reaction is:
H+(aq) + OH−(aq) → H2O(l)

Some simple definitions of acids and bases
A very simple definition of an acid is that it is a substance that neutralises a base. A salt and water are
formed.

The equation above also shows us a very simple definition of a base. A base is a substance that neutralises
an acid.

IMPORTANT
A base is a compound that contains oxide or hydroxide ions and reacts with an acid to form a salt and
water. Alkalis are bases which are soluble in water.
If we look at the formulae for some acids in Table 8.8, we see that they all contain hydrogen atoms. When
the acid dissolves in water, it ionises and forms hydrogen ions. Note that in organic acids such as
carboxylic acids (see Section 14.3), only some of the hydrogen atoms are capable of forming ions (see
Figure 8.11).

Figure 8.11: The sour taste of lemons is due to citric acid and that of vinegar is due to ethanoic acid. Baking soda is basic
and is used to make bread dough rise.

Acid–base equilibria are important in the human body (Figure 8.12).

Figure 8.12: Many foods have high quantities of sugar in them. The sugar is converted to acid by bacteria in your mouth.
This acid can attack the enamel on your teeth. By chewing sugar-free gum, more saliva is produced. Saliva is slightly
alkaline. It neutralises the acid.

Table 8.8: Formulae and ions of some common acids.

IMPORTANT
You must know the names and formulae of the first four acids in Table 8.8.
A better definition of an acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions when it dissolves in water. For
example:
HCl(g) + aq → H+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
The formulae for some bases are given in Table 8.9. Many metal oxides or hydroxides are bases. Some
bases dissolve in water to form hydroxide ions in solution. A base that is soluble in water is called an alkali.
For example:

NaOH(s) + aq → Na+(aq) + OH−(aq)
Some alkalis are formed by the reaction of a base with water. When ammonia gas dissolves in water, some
of the ammonia molecules react with water molecules. Hydroxide ions are released in this reaction.
NH3(g) + H2O(l) → NH4+ (aq) + OH−(aq)
Aqueous ammonia is therefore an alkali. We can also see from the equation above that the ammonia has
accepted a hydrogen ion to become NH4+. So a wider definition of a base is a substance that accepts
hydrogen ions.

IMPORTANT
Common alkalis that you must know are: sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and
ammonia (NH3)

b

c

Write ionic equations for:
i

the reaction in aqueous solution between sodium hydroxide and nitric acid

ii

The Brønsted–Lowry theory of acids and bases
The definitions of acids and bases given earlier are limited to reactions taking place in water. In 1923 the
Danish chemist J. Brønsted and the English chemist T. Lowry suggested a more general definition of acids
and bases. This definition is based on the idea that in an acid–base reaction, a proton is transferred from an
acid to a base (a hydrogen ion, H+, is a proton).
A Brønsted–Lowry acid is a proton donor.
A Brønsted–Lowry base is a proton acceptor.
When hydrochloric acid is formed, hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in water and reacts to form
hydroxonium ions, H3O+, and chloride ions (Figure 8.13). You can see that the water is involved in the
reaction.
HCl(g) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
Hydrochloric acid is an acid because it donates a proton to water. This means that water is acting as a
Brønsted–Lowry base. The water is accepting a proton:

Water can also act as an acid. When ammonia reacts with water, it accepts a proton from the water and
becomes an NH4+ ion (Figure 8.14).

Figure 8.13: An acid is a proton donor. Hydrogen chloride is the acid in this reaction. A base is a proton acceptor. Water is
the base in this reaction. Remember that a proton is a hydrogen ion, H+.

Figure 8.14: Water is the proton donor (it is the acid); ammonia is the proton acceptor (it is the base).

Substances like water, which can act as either acids or bases, are described as amphoteric.
Brønsted–Lowry acids and bases do not have to involve aqueous solutions. For example, when chloric(VII)
acid (HClO4) reacts with ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) in an inert solvent, the following equilibrium is set up:

In this reaction, HClO4 is the acid because it is donating a proton to CH3COOH. CH3COOH is the base
because it is a proton acceptor.

When an acid or base reacts with water, an equilibrium mixture is formed. For acids such as hydrochloric
acid, the position of equilibrium is almost entirely in favour of the products. But for ammonia, the position
of equilibrium favours the reactants. The equations can be written to show this. For example:
HCl(g) + aq → H+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
A forward arrow is used as this reaction goes to completion.
NH3(g) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH−(aq)
An equilibrium arrow is used as this reaction does not go to completion.

Questions
16 Identify which reactants are acids and which are bases in the following reactions:
a

NH4+ + H2O ⇌ NH3 + H3O+

b

HCOOH + HClO2 ⇌ HCOOH2+ + ClO2−

17 Identify the acid and the base on the right-hand side of these equilibria.
a

HClO2 + HCOOH ⇌ ClO2− + HCOOH2+

b

H2S + H2O ⇌ HS− + H3O+

Strong and weak acids and bases
Strong acids
IMPORTANT
When referring to acids and bases remember that weak and strong have to do with degree of
dissociation and not concentration. Concentration is to do with the number of moles per dm3. The
words to use here are ‘concentrated’ and ‘dilute’.
When hydrogen chloride dissolves in water to form a solution of concentration 0.1 mol dm−3, it ionises
almost completely. We say that the acid is almost completely dissociated.
HCl(g) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
The position of equilibrium is so far over to the right that we can show this as an irreversible reaction. The
pH of this 0.1 mol dm−3 solution is pH 1. The pH of a solution depends on the concentration of
hydroxonium ions, H3O+. The higher the concentration of hydroxonium ions, the lower the pH.
The low pH shows that there is a high concentration of hydroxonium ions in solution.
Acids that dissociate almost completely in aqueous solution are called strong acids.
The mineral acids, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid, are all strong acids.

IMPORTANT
Hydrogen ions in aqueous solution are correctly written as H3O+ (hydroxonium or oxonium ion). It is
often acceptable to simplify its structure as H+.
For example:
Ionisation of a strong acid: HCl → H+ + Cl−
Ionisation of a weak acid:
CH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO− + H+

Weak acids

When ethanoic acid dissolves in water to form a solution of concentration 0.1 mol dm−3, it is only slightly
ionised. There are many more molecules of ethanoic acid in solution than ethanoate ions and hydroxonium
ions. We say that the acid is partially (or incompletely) dissociated.

The position of equilibrium is well over to the left. The pH of this 0.1 mol dm−3 solution is pH 2.9. The pH is
much higher compared with a solution of hydrochloric acid of the same concentration. This is because the
concentration of hydroxonium ions in solution is far lower.
Acids that are only partially dissociated in solution are called weak acids.
Weak acids include most organic acids, hydrocyanic acid (HCN), hydrogen sulfide and ‘carbonic acid’.
Although we sometimes talk about the weak acid carbonic acid, you will never see a bottle of it. The acid is
really an equilibrium mixture of carbon dioxide dissolved in water. The following equilibrium is set up:
CO2(g) + H2O(l) ⇌ HCO3−(aq) + H+(aq)
The amount of CO2 that forms undissociated carbonic acid, H2CO3, is very small as H2CO3 ionises readily.

IMPORTANT
Sulfuric acid has two hydrogen ions that can ionise. The first hydrogen to ionise dissociates almost
completely:
H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4−.
HSO4−, however, behaves as a weak acid:
HSO4− ⇌ H+ + HSO4−

Strong bases
When sodium hydroxide dissolves in water to form a solution of concentration 0.1 mol dm−3, it ionises
completely.
NaOH(s) + aq → Na+(aq) + OH−(aq)
The position of equilibrium is far over to the right.
The solution formed is highly alkaline due to the high concentration of hydroxide ions present. The pH of
this 0.1 mol dm−3 solution is pH 13.
Bases that dissociate almost completely in solution are called strong bases.
The Group 1 metal hydroxides are strong bases.

Weak bases
When ammonia dissolves and reacts in water to form a solution of concentration 0.1 mol dm−3, it is only
slightly ionised. There are many more molecules of ammonia in solution than ammonium ions and
hydroxide ions.
NH3(g) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH−(aq)
The position of equilibrium is well over to the left. The pH of this 0.1 mol dm−3 solution is pH 11.1. The pH
is much lower compared with a solution of sodium hydroxide of the same concentration. This is because
the concentration of hydroxide ions in solution is far lower.
Bases which dissociate to only a small extent in solution are called weak bases.
Ammonia, amines (see Section 16.2) and some hydroxides of transition metals are weak bases.

c

Explain why a solution of 0.1 mol dm−3 ethanoic acid has a lower electrical conductivity than a

d

Both hydrochloric acid and ethanoic acid react with magnesium. The rate of reaction of 1.0 mol
dm−3 hydrochloric acid with magnesium is much faster than the rate of reaction of 1.0 mol dm−3
ethanoic acid. Explain why.

Distinguishing a weak acid from a strong acid
We can distinguish between a strong and weak acid by their pH values, electrical conductivity and
reactivity. When making these comparisons, we must use dilute solutions of strong and weak acids of the
same concentration.

pH values
Dilute solutions of a strong acids have lower pH values than those of weak acids of the same concentration.
This is because the concentration of hydrogen ions is greater in strong acids.

We can determine pH by;
Dipping a pH electrode into a solution of the acid: a pH meter connected to the pH electrode shows the
pH value.
Dipping universal indicator paper into a solution of the acid and noting the colour change. We then
compare the colour with that on a chart which shows the colours at different pH values.
Table 8.10 compares the pH values of some typical strong and weak acids and bases.

Electrical conductivity
Dilute solutions of a strong acids have greater electrical conductivity than those of weak acids of the same
concentration. This is because the concentration of hydrogen ions (and other ions) is greater in strong
acids.

We can determine electrical conductivity by dipping a conductivity electrode into a solution of the acid: a
conductivity meter connected to the electrode shows the conductivity.

Reaction with reactive metals
Dilute solutions of weak and strong acids of the same concentration have different reactivity with reactive
metals such as magnesium. When a piece of magnesium ribbon is added to a strong acid, a steady stream
of hydrogen bubbles is observed.
Mg(s) + 2HCl → MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)
When we add a piece of magnesium ribbon to a weak acid of the same concentration, only a few bubbles
are observed. This is because the concentration of hydrogen ions is greater in strong acids.

8.7 Indicators and acid–base titrations
In Chapter 3 we learned that indicators are used to detect the end-point in acid–alkali titrations. You may
also have used indicators such as litmus to test whether a substance is acidic or alkaline. In this section,
we shall look more closely at how specific indicators are used in titrations involving strong and weak acids
and bases.

Figure 8.15: The colour change in phenolphthalein is due to small differences in the structure of its molecule when
hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions are added.

Introducing indicators
An acid–base indicator is a dye or mixture of dyes that changes colour over a specific pH range (Figures
8.15 and 8.16). In simple terms, many indicators can be considered as weak acids in which the acid (HIn)
and its conjugate base (In−) have different colours.

Figure 8.16: The red petals of pelargonium (geranium) contain the dye pelargonidin. Hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions can
make small changes in its molecular structure to produce different colours.

IMPORTANT
An acid and base on different sides of the equation are said to be conjugate with each other if one can
be converted to the other by gain or loss of a hydrogen ion (see Chapter 21).

Adding an acid to this indicator solution shifts the position of equilibrium to the left. There are now
more molecules of colour A.
Adding an alkali shifts the position of equilibrium to the right. There are now more ions of colour B.
The colour of the indicator depends on the relative concentrations of HIn and In−. The colour of the
indicator during a titration depends on the concentration of H+ ions present.
Indicators usually change colour over a pH range of between 1 and 2 pH units. In the middle of the range
there is a recognisable end-point where the indicator has a colour in between the two extremes of colour.
For example, bromothymol blue is yellow in acidic solution and blue in alkaline solution. The colour change
takes place between pH 6.0 and pH 7.6. The end-point, which is a greyish-green colour, occurs when the
pH is 7.0.
The pH at which indicators begin to change colour varies considerably. Table 8.11 shows the colours,
ranges and end-points of some indicators.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 8.2
Monitoring pH change
In Section 3.7 we described the titration procedure for determining the amount of acid required to

neutralise an alkali. Figure 8.17 shows the apparatus used to follow the changes in pH when a base is
titrated with an acid.

Procedure
set up the apparatus with the pH electrode connected to the computer via a data logger
switch on the magnetic stirrer
deliver the acid at a constant slow rate from the burette into the alkali in the flask
stop when the pH has reached a nearly constant low value.
The pH of the reaction mixture can also be monitored manually. You record the pH after fixed volumes
of acid samples have been added to the flask, e.g. add one 1 cm3 sample at a time until the pH starts
changing rapidly, then add 0.5 cm3 samples.
The graphs recorded on the computer or drawn by hand show how pH varies with the volume of acid
added. The shapes of these graphs are characteristic and depend on whether the acid and base used
in the titration are strong or weak.

Figure 8.17: Measuring the pH change during the titration of sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid.

Strong acids with strong bases
Figure 8.18 shows how the pH changes when 0.100 mol dm−3 sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is titrated
with 0.100 mol dm−3 hydrochloric acid (a strong acid) in the presence of bromothymol blue indicator.

Figure 8.18: A strong acid–strong base titration with bromothymol blue as indicator.

These results show:
a sharp fall in the graph line between pH 10.5 and pH 3.5; in this region tiny additions of H+ ions result
in a rapid change in pH
a midpoint of the steep slope at pH 7
the midpoint of the sharp fall corresponds to the point at which the H+ ions in the acid have exactly
reacted with the OH− ions in the alkali; this is the end-point of the titration
bromothymol blue indicator changed from blue to yellow over the range 7.6 to 6.0 where the slope is
steepest.
Because there is a sharp change in pH over the region pH 3.5 to 10.5 we can use other indicators that
change colour within this region. For example, phenolphthalein changes colour in the pH range 8.2 to 10.0
(Figure 8.19).
Because the sharp pH change occurs over such a wide pH range, there are many indicators that can be
used to determine the end-point of the reaction of a strong acid with a strong base.

Figure 8.19: A strong acid–strong base titration with phenolphthalein as indicator.

Question
20 Use Table 8.11 to identify:
a

those indicators which could be used for a strong acid–strong base titration like the one in Figure
8.18.

b

those indicators that could not be used.

Strong acids with weak bases
Figure 8.20 shows how the pH changes when 0.100 mol dm−3 aqueous ammonia (a weak base) is titrated
with 0.100 mol dm−3 nitric acid (a strong acid).

Figure 8.20: A typical strong acid–weak base titration.

These results show:
a sharp fall in the graph line between pH 7.5 and pH 3.5
that the midpoint of the steep slope is at about pH 5.
Because there is a sharp change in pH over the region 3.5 to 7.5, we can use methyl red as an indicator for
this titration. This is because methyl red changes colour between pH 4.2 and pH 6.3, values that
correspond with the region of sharpest pH change. Phenolphthalein would not be a suitable indicator to use
because it only changes colour in alkaline regions (pH 8.2–10) that do not correspond to the sharp pH
change. The phenolphthalein would change colour only gradually as more and more acid is added, instead
of changing suddenly on the addition of a single drop at the end-point.

Weak acids with strong bases
Figure 8.21 shows how the pH changes when 0.100 mol dm−3 aqueous sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is
titrated with 0.100 mol dm−3 benzoic acid (a weak acid).

Figure 8.21: A typical weak acid–strong base titration.

These results show:
a sharp fall in the graph line between pH 11 and pH 7.5
that the midpoint of the steep slope is at about pH 9.
Because there is a sharp change in pH over the region pH 7.5 to 11 we can use phenolphthalein as an
indicator for this titration. This is because phenolphthalein changes colour between pH 8.2 and pH 10,
values that correspond with the region of sharpest pH change. Methyl orange would not be a suitable
indicator to use because it only changes colour in acidic regions that do not correspond to the sharp pH

Weak acids with weak bases
Figure 8.22 shows how the pH changes when 0.100 mol dm−3 aqueous ammonia (a weak base) is titrated
with 0.100 mol dm−3 aqueous benzoic acid (a weak acid).

Figure 8.22: A typical weak acid–weak base titration.

These results show that there is no sharp fall in the graph line. No acid–base indicator is suitable to
determine the end-point of this reaction. In the example shown, bromothymol blue:
starts changing colour when 19.50 cm3 of acid have been added
finishes changing colour when 20.50 cm3 of acid have been added.
Such a gradual colour change on addition of acid is not good enough when you need to be able to read the
end-point to the nearest 0.05 cm3.

SUMMARY
For some chemical reactions, dynamic equilibrium is reached when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions
are equal so the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant.
Le Chatelier’s principle states that, if a change is made to a system at dynamic equilibrium, the position of
equilibrium moves to minimise this change.
Changes in temperature, pressure and concentration of reactants and products affect the position of equilibrium,
but the value of equilibrium constant is only affected by a change in temperature.
For an equilibrium reaction, there is a relationship between the concentrations of the reactants and products which
is given by the equilibrium constant in terms of concentrations, Kc, and / or partial pressure, Kp.
Equilibrium constants in terms of concentrations, Kc, and partial pressure, Kp, can be deduced from appropriate
data.
The Brønsted–Lowry theory of acids and bases states that acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors.
Strong acids and bases are completely dissociated in aqueous solution whereas weak acids and bases are only
slightly dissociated.

SLOWING THE RATE CAN BE IMPORTANT

Figure 9.1: a The reactions that produce firework explosions need to take place in a fraction of a second. b Corrosion
of some metals, such as the rusting of iron, is a much slower reaction.

As Figure 9.1 shows, some chemical reactions are very fast (they have a high rate of reaction) and
others are much slower. Some reactions are not very useful to us: for example, rusting of iron,
decomposition of wood, and browning of foodstuffs. The rate of a chemical reaction depends on many
things. Rusting takes place very slowly in dry air. It takes much longer for iron to rust in the dry desert
compared with the much faster rusting which takes place in seawater. The rate of rusting also depends
on pH: faster rusting occurs at low pH values (green rust) and high pH values (red rust). There are
several other things that speed up or slow down chemical reactions. One of the most obvious is the
effect of temperature. Unwanted oxidation reactions such as the browning of foods can be slowed
down by reducing the temperature.
Change in temperature has a great effect on biological and chemical molecules in plants and animals.
Increasing the temperature makes respiration faster and the chemical reactions in our body
(metabolism) also speed up. But if the temperature is too high (over about 40 °C) the rate of enzymecatalysed reactions in our bodies starts to decrease because the structure of the enzymes and other
proteins in the body is changed. If the temperature is too low, the rate of metabolism gets too low and
we may get hypothermia, where the body temperature drops to a dangerously low level.
But in some cases, low body temperatures can be useful. During some surgical operations patients are
cooled down to help lower the rate of respiration and rate of blood flow. Lowering the temperature of
the blood improves the chances of survival in complex heart operations such as cardiac bypass
surgery. The cooled blood is passed through a heart−lung machine which keeps the blood flowing
through the body. The temperature of the body is gradually lowered from 37 °C to 30−32 °C. This
lowers the rate of reactions in the body and protects the brain and other organs from damage while
the heart is stopped during surgery.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
If left in the open, food usually goes bad because of oxidation or decomposition reactions. Which
foods go bad quickly? What can we do to stop food going bad?

In places that have seasons which are very cold, some animals lower their body temperature. What
is the advantage of this?
Make a list of other reactions that are very fast or very slow. Compare your answers with other
groups.

9.1 Rate of reaction
The study of rates of chemical reactions is called reaction kinetics. The data we gather from rate
experiments can tell us a lot about how reactions take place. We can then make deductions about the
mechanism of a reaction. The balanced chemical equation gives us no information about the rate of a
reaction. Experiments are needed to measure the rate at which reactants are used up or products are
formed.
The rate of a reaction can be defined as follows:
rate =
Units of concentration are usually expressed in mol dm−3. Units of time are usually expressed in seconds.
So, the units of rate of reaction are normally mol dm−3 s−1. For very slow reactions, you may see the
units of rates expressed as mol dm−3 min−1 or mol dm−3 h−1.

Question
Convert the following rates into the units of mol dm−3 s−1:

1

a

0.254 g of I2 consumed in 1.00 h in a reaction mixture of volume 1 dm3. (Ar[I] = 127)

b

0.0440 g ethyl ethanoate formed in 1.00 min from a reaction mixture of volume 400 cm3.
(Mr [CH3COOC2H5] = 88.0)

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 9.1
Methods for following the course of a reaction
In order to find out how the rate of reaction changes with time, we need to select a suitable method to
follow the progress of a reaction. This method will measure either the rate of disappearance of a
reactant, or the rate of appearance of a product. There are two main types of method: sampling and
continuous.
1

Sampling

This method involves taking small samples of the reaction mixture at various times and then carrying
out a chemical analysis on each sample. An example is the alkaline hydrolysis of bromobutane:
C4H9Br + OH− → C4H9OH + Br −
Samples are removed at various times and ‘quenched’ to stop or slow down the reaction, e.g. by
cooling the sample in ice. The hydroxide ion concentration can be found by titration with a standard
solution of a strong acid.
2

Continuous

In this method a physical property of the reaction mixture is monitored over a period of time. Some
examples are using colorimetry, a conductivity meter or measuring changes in gas volume or gas
pressure.

Figure 9.2: We can use a colorimeter to monitor the progress of a reaction. It measures the transmission of light
through a ‘cell’ containing the reaction mixture. The less concentrated the colour of the reaction mixture, the more
light is transmitted through the ‘cell’.

Colorimetry can be used to monitor the change in colour of a particular reactant (Figure 9.2). For
example, we can use this method to follow the reaction of iodine with propanone:
CH3COCH3 + I2 → CH3COCH2I + HI
As the reaction proceeds, the colour of the iodine fades.
Changes in electrical conductivity of a solution can also be measured. For example, we can use this
method to follow the reaction:
(CH3)3CBr + H2O → (CH3)3COH + H+ + Br−
As the reaction proceeds, the electrical conductivity of the solution increases because ions are being
formed in the reaction. This method can sometimes be used even if there are ions on both sides of the
equation, because ions vary in their conductivities. For example, the small H+ and OH− ions have very
high conductivities but Br− ions have a low conductivity.
We can measure changes in gas volume or gas pressure. For example, we can use this method to
follow the reaction of benzenediazonium chloride, C6H5N≡N+Cl−, with water.
C6H5N≡N+Cl−(aq) + H2O(l) → C6H5OH(aq) + N2(g) + HCl(aq)
We can monitor the reaction by measuring the change in volume of gas released with time. You may
have used this method to follow the rate of the reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric
acid. If you did, you will have measured the change in volume of carbon dioxide gas released with time
(Figure 9.3).
The progress of some reactions can be followed by measuring small changes in the volume of the
reaction mixture. For example, during the hydration of methylpropene, the volume decreases.
(CH3)2C═CH2 + H2O

(CH3)3COH + H+

Figure 9.3: We can follow the rate of reaction by measuring the change in volume of a gas given off in a reaction. In
this experiment, CO2 is being given off when CaCO3 reacts with HCl.

An instrument called a dilatometer (Figure 9.4) is used to measure the small changes in volume. The
temperature has to be controlled to an accuracy of ±0.001 °C. Can you think why?

Figure 9.4: A dilatometer.

Question
2

a

b

Suggest a suitable method for following the progress of each of these reactions:
i

H2O2(aq) + 2I−(aq) + 2H+(aq) → 2H2O(l) + I2(aq)

ii

HCOOCH3(aq) + H2O(l) → HCOOH(aq) + CH3OH(aq)

iii

2H2O2(aq) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g)

iv

BrO3−(aq) + 5Br −(aq) + 6H+(aq) → 3Br2(aq) + 3H2O(l)

Why is it essential to keep the temperature constant when measuring the progress of a reaction?

Calculating rate of reaction graphically
Rate of reaction usually changes as the reaction proceeds. This is because the concentration of reactants is
decreasing. Taking the isomerisation of cyclopropane to propene as an example:

We can follow the progress of this reaction by measuring the decrease in concentration of cyclopropane or
increase in concentration of propene. Table 9.2 shows these changes at 500 °C. The measurements were
all made at the same temperature because reaction rate is greatly affected by temperature.

Note that we put square brackets, [ ], around the cyclopropane and propene to indicate concentration:
[propene] means ‘concentration of propene’.
Figure 9.5 shows how the concentration of propene changes with time.

Figure 9.5: How the concentration of propene changes with time in the reaction cyclopropane → propene. a the whole
curve. b The first part of the curve magnified. Line A shows the average rate over the first 5 minutes. Line B shows the
actual initial rate found by drawing a tangent at the start of the curve.

We can see from Figure 9.5b that the concentration of propene increases from 0.00 to 0.27 mol dm−3 in the
first 5 minutes. In Section 6.1 we used the symbol Δ (Greek capital ‘delta’) to represent a change in a
particular quantity. So we can write:

This gives the average rate of reaction over the first 5 minutes. You will notice, however, that the graph is a
curve which becomes shallower with time. So the rate decreases with time. By measuring the change in
concentration over shorter and shorter time intervals we get an increasingly accurate value of the reaction
rate. If we make the time interval over which we measure the reaction almost zero, we obtain a reaction
rate at a particular instant. We do this by drawing tangents at particular points on the curve. Line B in
Figure 9.5b shows a tangent drawn at the start of the curve. This gives a much more accurate value of the
initial rate of reaction.

WORKED EXAMPLE
1

Figure 9.6 shows how to draw a tangent and calculate the rate at a particular point on a curve. In
this case, we are using a graph of concentration of cyclopropane against time.

Figure 9.6: The rate of decrease of cyclopropane concentration over time as the reaction proceeds. The rate of
reaction at a given time can be found by drawing a tangent and measuring the gradient.

Procedure
Step 1:

Select a point on the graph corresponding to a particular time (10 minutes in this
example).

Step 2:

Draw a straight line at this point so that it just touches the line. The two angles
between the straight line and the curve should look very similar.

Step 3:

Extend the tangent to meet the axes of the graph.

Step 4:

Calculate the gradient (slope) of the tangent. This is a measure of the rate of reaction.
In this example the slope is:
slope =
= −6.67 × 10−4 mol dm−3 s−1

Note:
we convert the minutes to seconds by multiplying by 60
the sign of the gradient is negative because the reactant concentration is decreasing
the value of −6.67 × 10−4 mol dm−3 s−1 refers to the rate of change of cyclopropane
concentration
this is the rate of reaction when the cyclopropane concentration is 1.00 mol dm−3.

Changes in rate as the reaction proceeds
As time passes, the concentration of cyclopropane falls. We can find the rate at different concentrations of
cyclopropane by drawing tangents at several points on the graph. Figure 9.7 shows how this is done for
cyclopropane concentrations of 1.50 mol dm−3 (the initial rate), 1.00 mol dm−3 and 0.50 mol dm−3. The
data is summarised in Table 9.3.

Table 9.3: Rates of decrease for cyclopropane at different concentrations, calculated from Figure 9.7.

A graph of rate of reaction against concentration of cyclopropane (Figure 9.8) shows us that the rate is
directly proportional to the concentration of cyclopropane. So, if the concentration of cyclopropane is
doubled the rate of reaction is doubled. If the concentration of cyclopropane falls by one-third, the rate of
reaction falls by one-third.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 9.2
The reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid
By collecting data and then analysing it, we can work out the relationship between the rate of reaction
and concentration of reactant. In this case we are going to use the apparatus shown in Figure 9.9 to
collect data about the reaction between marble chips (calcium carbonate) and hydrochloric acid. The
marble chips are in excess.
CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl2(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Procedure

Figure 9.9: Apparatus needed to measure the volume of gas given off in the reaction.

1

Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 9.9 but remove the stopper from the flask and set the
syringe to zero.

2

Put about 10 g of large marble chips into the flask. Each marble chip should be about the same
size and weigh 1.5−1.8 g.

3

Put 20 cm3 of acid into the flask and leave for two seconds for the solution to become saturated
with carbon dioxide.

4

Put the stopper on the flask and immediately start a stopclock.

5

Record the volume of the gas in the syringe every 30 s until there is no further change in volume.

Record your results in a table with these headings:
time / s
volume of gas (Vt ) / cm3
final volume of gas − volume of gas at time t (Vf − Vt ) / cm3
The hydrochloric acid is the limiting reactant. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of the
hydrochloric acid decreases. Vf − Vt is proportional to the concentration of hydrochloric acid at each
time, t.
Plot a graph of Vf − Vt against time, t, and look at its shape. This will give us information about the
kinetics of the reaction (see Chapter 22).

What obstacles did your partner help you overcome?

Collision theory
When we explain the effects of concentration, temperature, surface area and catalysts on rates of reaction,
we use the collision theory. Collision theory states that in order to react with each other, particles must
collide in the correct orientation and with sufficient energy. The particles might be atoms, ions or
molecules.
When reactant particles collide they may simply bounce off each other, without changing. This is called an
ineffective collision. An ineffective collision takes place if the colliding particles do not have enough
energy to react. No reaction occurs. If the reactant particles do have enough energy to react, they may
change into product particles when they collide. This is called an effective collision (or successful
collision) (Figure 9.10).

Figure 9.10: a Ineffective (unsuccessful) and b effective (successful) collisions.

The minimum energy that colliding particles must possess for a collision to be effective is called the
activation energy, EA, for that particular reaction.
We can show the activation energy for an exothermic reaction and an endothermic reaction on reaction
pathway diagrams, as in Figures 9.11 and 9.12.

Figure 9.11: The activation energy in an exothermic reaction.

Figure 9.12: The activation energy in an endothermic reaction.

According to the collision theory, a reaction will speed up if:
the frequency of collisions increases
the proportion of particles with energy greater than the activation energy increases.
The frequency of collisions is the number of collisions per unit time, e.g. number of collisions per second.
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction but remains chemically unchanged itself at
the end of the reaction. A catalyst does this by making it possible for the particles to react by an
alternative mechanism. This alternative mechanism has a lower activation energy (see Figure 9.13). You
can read more about catalysts in Section 9.4.

A

B

C

Use the collision theory to explain how increasing the surface area of a solid reactant increases
the rate of reaction.

9.2 The effect of concentration on rate of reaction
IMPORTANT
Remember that increase in concentration of a reactant increases rate because it increases the
frequency of the collisions. It is not enough to write ‘there are more collisions’. You must include an
idea of collisions per second. Frequency is a number (of something) per second.
In chemistry, we usually measure the concentration of solutions in moles per decimetre cubed: mol dm−3.
The more concentrated a solution, the greater the number of particles of solute dissolved in a given
volume of solvent. In reactions involving solutions, more concentrated reactants have a faster rate of
reaction. This is because the random motion of the particles in solution results in more frequent collisions
between reacting particles. This is shown in Figure 9.14.
The effect of pressure in reactions involving gases is similar to the effect of concentration in solutions. As
we increase the pressure of reacting gases, there are more gas molecules in a given volume. This results in
more collisions in any given time, and a faster rate of reaction.

Figure 9.14: The particles in box a are closer together than those in box b. There are more particles in the same volume,
so the chances and frequency of collisions between reacting particles are increased. Therefore, the rate of reaction is
greater in box a than in box b.

A

The particles have more energy and collide with a greater frequency

B

The particles are closer together and there are more collisions.

C

The particles are closer together and collide more frequently.

D

The particles have a greater collision rate because they collide more effectively.

9.3 The effect of temperature on rate of reaction
To fully understand rates of reaction, we need to look more closely at the energy possessed by the reactant
particles.
In a sample of any substance, at a given temperature, the particles will not all possess the same amount of
energy as each other. A few particles will have a relatively small amount of energy. A few particles will have
a relatively large amount of energy. Most particles will have an amount of energy somewhere in between.
The distribution of energies at a given temperature can be shown on a graph (see Figure 9.15). This is
called the Boltzmann distribution.

Figure 9.15: The Boltzmann distribution of molecular energies, showing the activation energy.

In Figure 9.15, the activation energy, EA, is labelled. We have seen that the activation energy is defined as
the minimum energy required for colliding particles to react. When we raise the temperature of a reaction
mixture, the average kinetic (movement) energy of the particles increases. Particles in solution and in
gases will move around more quickly at a higher temperature, resulting in more frequent collisions.
However, experiments show us that the effect of temperature on rate of reaction cannot be totally
explained by more frequent collisions. The key factor is that the proportion of successful collisions
increases greatly as we increase the temperature. The distribution of molecular energies changes as we
raise the temperature, as shown in Figure 9.16. The curve showing the Boltzmann distribution at the higher
temperature flattens and the peak shifts to the right.
The area under the curve represents the number of particles. The shaded area shows the number of
particles with energy greater than the activation energy, EA. For a 10 °C rise in temperature this area under
the curve approximately doubles, as does the rate of many reactions.

Figure 9.16: The Boltzmann distribution of molecular energies at temperatures T °C and (T + 10) °C, showing the
activation energy.

Therefore, increasing the temperature increases the rate of reaction because:
the increased energy results in particles moving around more quickly, which increases the frequency of
collisions
the proportion of successful collisions (i.e. those that result in a reaction) increases because the
proportion of particles exceeding the activation energy increases. This is the more important factor.

IMPORTANT
Remember that increasing temperature increases the rate of reaction because of two factors:
1

The frequency of effective collisions is greater because of the greater kinetic energy of the
molecules

2

A greater proportion of the molecules have kinetic energy greater than the activation energy.

The second reason has a far greater effect.

Question
7

a

What is the Boltzmann distribution?

b

Explain why a 10 °C rise in temperature can approximately double the rate of a reaction.

9.4 Catalysis
IMPORTANT
Catalysts increase the rate because they make the reaction go by a different reaction pathway
(mechanism) that has a lower activation energy than the uncatalysed reaction.
In Figure 9.13 we saw how a catalyst works by providing an alternative mechanism (or reaction pathway)
with a lower activation energy. We can show this on a Boltzmann distribution (see Figure 9.17).
Note that the presence of a catalyst does not affect the shape of the Boltzmann distribution. However, by
providing a lower activation energy, a greater proportion of molecules in the reaction mixture have
sufficient energy to react. The shaded area under the curve represents the numbers of molecules that have
energy greater than the activation energy of the reaction. The total shaded area (including both the light
and dark shading) under the curve shows the number of particles with energy greater than the activation
energy with the catalyst present (EA(cat)). This area is much larger than the dark shaded area for the
reaction without a catalyst. Therefore, the rate at which effective collisions occur, and so the rate of the
catalysed reaction, is greatly increased compared with the rate of the uncatalysed reaction.

Figure 9.17: The Boltzmann distribution of molecular energies, showing the change in activation energy with and without
a catalyst.

Question
8

Which one of these statements about the Boltzmann curve is correct?
A

The Boltzmann curve shows that for most reactions, most particles have energies greater than
the activation energy.

B

The Boltzmann curve shows the total number of particles on the y-axis and the activation energy
on the x-axis.

C

When the temperature of a chemical reaction is increased the highest point on the Boltzmann
curve is still the same.

D

At constant temperature, the area under the Boltzmann curve above the activation energy is
greater for a catalysed reaction than for the same uncatalysed reaction.

2

Compare your lists of key words and definitions with those of another learner. Which ones did you
miss out? Were these more difficult ones to explain?

Homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts

When a catalyst and the reactants in a catalysed reaction are in the same phase, we describe the catalyst
as a homogeneous catalyst. For example, we can describe a catalyst as homogeneous if it is dissolved in
water and the reactants are also present as an aqueous solution.
If the catalyst is in a different phase to the reactants, we describe the catalyst as a heterogeneous catalyst.
You have probably met an example of heterogeneous catalysis when making oxygen gas. The reaction
commonly used in the laboratory is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide solution:
2H2O2(aq) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g)

slow reaction

This is a very slow reaction at room temperature. However, when a little of the insoluble solid
manganese(IV) oxide powder, MnO2(s), is added, oxygen is given off quickly (Figure 9.18).
2H2O2(aq)

fast reaction

2H2O(l) + O2(g)

At the end of the reaction, when no more gas is being released, you can recover the solid catalyst by
filtering off the water and drying the black powder of manganese(IV) oxide.
Many heterogeneous catalysts are solids that catalyse gaseous reactants. The reactions take place on the
surface of the solid catalyst. There are many examples in industry, including the iron catalyst used in the
manufacture of ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas, and the nickel catalyst used when adding
hydrogen gas to vegetable oils to make margarine.

manganese(IV) oxide added.

ii
b

2SO3(g)

Explain how a catalyst increases the rate of reaction in terms of activation energy and the
distribution of molecular energies in a sample of reactants.

Draw a reaction profile diagram to show a typical uncatalysed reaction and the catalysed version
of the reaction. On your diagram show the activation energy for the catalysed and uncatalysed
reactions.

SUMMARY
The rate of reaction can be found by drawing tangents to a curve of extent of reaction against time.
At higher concentration (or higher pressure), more frequent collisions occur between reactant molecules. This
increases the rate of reaction.
The activation energy of a reaction, EA, is the minimum energy required by colliding particles for a collision to be
effective. Reaction pathway diagrams show how the activation energy provides a barrier to reaction.
At higher temperature, molecules have more kinetic energy, so a higher percentage of successful collisions occur
between reactant molecules.
The Boltzmann distribution represents the numbers of molecules in a sample with particular energies. The change
in the Boltzmann distribution as temperature is increased shows how more molecules have energy greater than the
activation energy. This in turn leads to an increase in reaction rate.
A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy.
More molecules have sufficient energy to react, so the rate of reaction is increased. The catalyst is not used up in
the reaction.

ARRANGING THE ELEMENTS
The chemical elements that we know were gradually discovered over many thousands of years. The
first metal elements used by early humans, e.g. copper, gold, were found naturally. Evidence from the
Middle East and Africa suggests that copper was extracted by heating with charcoal over 7000 years
ago. Humans were extracting lead in Africa over 6000 years ago and over 5000 years ago, people
were extracting iron from iron ore in Egypt. The progress in extracting other elements was slow until
about 260–220 years ago when there was a sudden increase in the ‘discovery’ of new elements.
Elements such as hydrogen, chlorine and manganese were ‘discovered’ in this period. A little later
(1807), sodium and potassium were isolated by electrolysis.
Because so many elements were then known, chemists started to group them together and link them
to their ‘atomic weights’. Johann Döbereiner and John Newlands produced tables which showed that
there was a relationship between the properties of some elements and their ‘atomic weights’. It was
not until 1869 that the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev arranged the elements into the Periodic
Table that we know today (Figure 10.1). He organised the elements known at that time in order of their
atomic mass, arranging elements with similar properties into vertical columns. He left gaps where the
pattern broke down, arguing that these spaces would eventually be filled by as yet undiscovered
elements. For example, he left a space below silicon, and he made predictions of how the ‘new’

element would behave when it was discovered. He also changed the order of elements in places where
similar elements did not quite line up in columns based on atomic mass. These apparent
inconsistencies resulted in some of his fellow chemists doubting the importance of his table, but they
were convinced following the discovery of germanium in 1886. Germanium closely matched the
properties that Mendeleev had predicted for the ‘new’ element below silicon, using his Periodic Table.

Figure 10.1: a Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907). b This version of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table is on the building in St
Petersburg where he worked.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, further elements, many of which exist for only a few seconds because
they are radioactively unstable, have been added to the Periodic Table. Many of these have been
discovered by female scientists such as Marie Curie (radium and polonium), Lisa Meitner
(protactinium) and Marguerite Perey (francium). One of the latest elements to be discovered is
tennessine, which has an atomic number of 117. Which group is this in?

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Why do you think that elements such as copper and lead were the first to be extracted but it was
not until about 200 years ago that sodium and potassium were extracted?
Neither the noble gases nor the radioactive elements in Period 7 appear in Mendeleev’s table
because they had not been discovered. What features of these elements do you think made their
discovery difficult?

10.1 Structure of the Periodic Table
We now know that the chemical elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in order of atomic number, not
atomic mass as first thought. This explains why Mendeleev had to re-order some elements in his table
(which was developed before scientists knew about the structure of the atom). The modern Periodic Table
is shown in Figure 10.3 in Section 10.2. There are 18 groups (vertical columns) in the Periodic Table. The
rows across the table are called periods. In this chapter we will be looking for patterns going across the
third period, from sodium (Na) to argon (Ar). The patterns seen across Period 3 are seen across other
periods, too. This recurrence of the same pattern is called periodicity.

Figure 10.3: The Periodic Table of the elements. A larger version of the Periodic Table can be found in Appendix 1.

IMPORTANT
The latest accepted form of the Periodic Table has groups numbered from 1 to 18. The transition
elements are given group numbers. It is easy to change the old Groups III to VIII into the modern form.
You just add 10. So Group III becomes Group 13 and Group VII becomes 17.

Question
1

Look at the Periodic Table in Figure 10.3.
a

Which element is found in Period 4, Group 17?

b

The relative atomic masses of tellurium (Te) and iodine (I) are 128 and 127, respectively. Why did
this present a problem to Mendeleev when he was constructing his Periodic Table?

c

Why are the elements in Groups 1 and 2 known as ‘s-block elements’, whereas those in Group 17
are called ‘p-block elements’?

10.2 Periodicity of physical properties
Periodic patterns of atomic radii
We can compare the size of different atoms using their atomic radii. The data for these measurements can
come from an element’s single covalent radius (Figure 10.2).

Figure 10.2: The distance between the two nuclei of the same type of atom can be determined and then divided by two
to arrive at the atomic (single covalent) radius.

There are other measures of atomic radii, such as metallic radii and van der Waals’ radii. However,
covalent radii can be obtained for most elements, so these provide the best data for comparison purposes
across a period.
The values of the atomic radii of the elements in Period 3 are given in Table 10.1. We can see the pattern
across the period more clearly on a graph (Figure 10.4).

Table 10.1: The atomic (single covalent) radii of Period 3 elements (no data are available for argon). The units are
nanometres, where 1 nm = 10−9 m.

IMPORTANT
The atomic radius decreases across a period because the increasingly positive nuclear charge pulls the
electrons in the outer shell closer to the nucleus.
The atoms of the noble gases in Group 18, such as argon in Period 3, do not have a covalent radius, as they
do not form bonds with each other. Their atomic radii can be determined from their van der Waals’ radius.
This is found by measuring the distance between the nuclei of two neighbouring, touching atoms which are
not chemically bonded together. This distance is divided by two to give the van der Waals’ radius. This
figure will be higher than the single covalent radius of any given element, as there is no overlap of electron
clouds involved in the van der Waals’ radius.
The atomic radius decreases across Period 3, as shown in Figure 10.4. The same pattern is also found in
other periods. Across a period, the number of protons (and so the nuclear charge) and the number of
electrons increases by one with each successive element. The extra electron added to the atoms of each
successive element occupies the same principal quantum shell (energy level). This means that the
shielding effect remains roughly constant (see Section 2.2), so the greater attractive force exerted by the
increasing positive nuclear charge on the outer (valence) shell electrons pulls them in closer to the
nucleus. For this reason, the atomic radius decreases across the period.

Figure 10.4: Plotting the atomic radii (single covalent radii) against atomic number for the elements in Period 3 (argon
not included).

Periodic patterns of ionic radii
IMPORTANT
The ionic radius decreases across a period as the positive charge on the ion increases and the
negative charge on the ion decreases. This is because the increasingly positive nuclear charge pulls
the electrons in the outer shell closer to the nucleus. In the same period, the negative ions have larger
ionic radii than the positive ions because they have one more electron shell, so the outer electrons are
further from the nucleus and there is more shielding.
From your work in Chapter 4, you will know that the atoms of metallic elements produce positively charged
ions (called cations), such as Na+. By contrast, the atoms of non-metallic elements form negatively
charged ions (called anions), such as Cl−. What pattern in ionic radii do we see going across Period 3? The
data are shown in Table 10.2 and are displayed graphically in Figure 10.5.

Table 10.2: The ionic radii of Period 3 elements (no data are available for argon).

The positively charged ions have effectively lost their outer shell of electrons (the third principal quantum
shell or energy level) from their original atoms. For this reason, the cations are much smaller than their
atoms. To add to this effect, there is also less shielding of the outer electrons in these cations compared
with their original atoms.
Going across the period, from Na+ to Si4+, the ions get smaller for reasons similar to those for the
decreasing atomic radii across a period. The increasing nuclear charge attracts the outermost (valenceshell) electrons in the second principal quantum shell (energy level) closer to the nucleus with increasing
atomic number.
The negatively charged ions are larger than their original atoms. This is because each atom will have
gained one or more extra electrons into their third principal quantum shell. This increases the repulsion
between its electrons, while the nuclear charge remains constant. This increases the size of any anion
compared with its atom.

Figure 10.5: Plotting the ionic radii against atomic number for the elements in Period 3 (argon not included).

The anions decrease in size, going from P3− to Cl−, as the nuclear charge increases across the period.

Physical properties, such as the melting point and electrical conductivity of the elements, also show trends
across a period. Again, using Period 3 as an example, we can show the data in tables and on graphs (see

The electrical conductivity increases across the metals of Period 3 from sodium (Group 1) to aluminium
(Group 13). The electrical conductivity then drops dramatically to silicon, which is described as a
semiconductor, and falls even further to the non-metallic insulators phosphorus and sulfur.
To explain the trend in melting points and electrical conductivity across a period, we have to consider the
bonding and structure of the elements (see Table 10.5).

Table 10.5: The bonding and structures of Period 3 elements.

Sodium, magnesium and aluminium, at the start of Period 3, are all metallic elements. As you saw in
Section 4.6, their metallic bonding can be described as positive ions arranged in a giant lattice held
together by a ‘sea’ of delocalised electrons. The delocalised electrons are those from the outermost
(valence) shell. These delocalised electrons are free to move around within the structure of the metal.
When a potential difference is applied, the delocalised electrons drift through the metal towards the
positive terminal. Both the melting point and the electrical conductivity increase from sodium to
magnesium to aluminium. This can be explained by the number of electrons each metal donates into the
‘sea’ of delocalised electrons and the increasing charge on the metal ions in the giant metallic lattice. Each
sodium atom donates just one electron, forming Na+ ions in the lattice, whereas each aluminium atom
donates three electrons, forming Al3+ ions. This makes the metallic bonding in aluminium stronger, as the
electrostatic forces of attraction between its 3+ ions and the larger number of negatively charged
delocalised electrons holding the giant structure together are stronger. There are also more delocalised
electrons available to drift through the structure when aluminium metal conducts an electric current,
making aluminium a better electrical conductor than sodium.

Figure 10.6: Plotting the melting point against atomic number for the elements in Period 3.

IMPORTANT
The change in melting point across a period reflects the type of structure and bonding. As we go
across a period, the metals have increasingly strong metallic bonding and their melting points
increase. In Period 2 and Period 3, the Group 14 elements have giant covalent structures so have very
high melting points. In Groups 15 to 18, most of the elements have simple molecular structures so
have relatively low melting points.
The element in the centre of Period 3, silicon, has the highest melting point because of its giant molecular
structure (also called a giant covalent structure). Every silicon atom is held to its neighbouring silicon
atoms by strong covalent bonds. However, its electrical conductivity is much lower than the metals at the
start of the period because there are no delocalised electrons free to move around within its structure.
Silicon is classed as a semimetal, or metalloid.
The elements to the right of silicon are all non-metallic elements. They exist as relatively small molecules.
Sulfur exists as S8 molecules, phosphorus as P4 molecules and chlorine as Cl2 molecules. Although the
covalent bonds within each molecule are strong, there are only relatively weak instantaneous dipole–
induced dipole forces between their molecules (see Section 4.7). Therefore, it does not take much energy
to break these weak intermolecular forces and melt the elements. At room temperature, phosphorus and

sulfur are solids with low melting points and chlorine is a gas.
Argon gas exists as single atoms with very weak instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces between these
atoms.

Periodic patterns of first ionisation energies
You have looked at the pattern in first ionisation energies for the first two periods in Section 2.6. In Period 3
the pattern is the same as in Period 2. This is shown by the data in Table 10.6 and the graph in Figure 10.7.

Figure 10.7: Plotting the first ionisation energy (X(g) → X+(g) + e−) against atomic number for the elements in Period 3.

IMPORTANT

There is a general increase in first ionisation energy across a period because the increasing nuclear
charge and decreasing atomic radius makes the attractive forces between the nucleus and outer
electrons greater. Remember that Group 13 and Group 16 elements may not obey this general rule
(see Chapter 2).
In general, the first ionisation energy increases across Period 3 as the positive nuclear charge increases
and electrons successively fill the third quantum shell. As electrons are in the same shell, the shielding
effect is similar in atoms of each element. There are small ‘dips’ in the general trend across the period
between Mg and Al, and between P and S. The same pattern appears in Period 2 for Be and B, and N and O.
The explanation given in Section 2.6 also applies here in Period 3.

10.3 Periodicity of chemical properties
We will now look at the chemistry of some of the elements of Period 3 and their compounds, focusing on
the oxides and chlorides.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 10.1
Reactions of Period 3 elements with oxygen
Some of these experiments may be demonstrated by your teacher. Watch carefully to see what
happens and note down your observations.
1

Sodium reacts vigorously when heated and placed in a gas jar of oxygen. The sodium burns with a
bright yellow flame (Figure 10.8). The main product when sodium burns in a limited amount of
oxygen is a white solid, sodium oxide:
4Na(s) + O2(g) → 2Na2O(s)

Figure 10.8: Sodium reacts vigorously with oxygen gas.

2

Magnesium also reacts vigorously when heated in oxygen, forming magnesium oxide. Aluminium
metal is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide, but powdered aluminium does react well with
oxygen. Both metals burn with bright white flames.
2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)
4Al(s) + 3O2(g) → 2Al2O3(s)

3

Silicon reacts slowly with oxygen to form silicon(IV) oxide (silicon dioxide):
Si(s) + O2(g) → SiO2(s)

4

Phosphorus reacts vigorously with oxygen. A yellow or white flame is seen, and clouds of white
phosphorus(V) oxide are produced:
4P(s) + 5O2(g) → P4O10(s)

5

Sulfur powder, once ignited, burns gently with a blue flame in a gas jar of oxygen gas. Toxic fumes
of sulfur dioxide gas are produced (Figure 10.9):
S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g)
Further oxidation of sulfur dioxide gives sulfur trioxide. Their systematic names are sulfur(IV) oxide
and sulfur(VI) oxide, respectively.

2SO2(g) + O2(g)
6

2SO3(g)

Chlorine and argon do not react with oxygen.

Figure 10.9: Sulfur burns gently in oxygen gas.

Reactions of Period 3 elements with chlorine
When sodium metal is heated then plunged into a gas jar of chlorine there is a vigorous reaction, forming
sodium chloride:
2Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2NaCl(s)
Magnesium and aluminium also react vigorously with chlorine gas:
Mg(s) + Cl2(g) → MgCl2(s)
2Al(s) + 3Cl2(g) → Al2Cl6(s)
Silicon reacts slowly with chlorine, as it does with oxygen, giving silicon(IV) chloride:
Si(s) + 2Cl2(g) → SiCl4(l)
Phosphorus also reacts slowly with excess chlorine gas:
2P(s) + 5Cl2(g) → 2PCl5(l)
Sulfur does form chlorides, such as SCl2 and S2Cl2, but you do not need to cover these for your
examination.
Argon does not form a chloride.

Reactions of sodium and magnesium with water
PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 10.2
Reaction of sodium and magnesium with water
Some of these experiments may be demonstrated by your teacher. Watch carefully to see what
happens and note down your observations.
1

Sodium reacts vigorously with cold water, melting into a ball of molten metal (Figure 10.10). It
moves across the surface of the water, giving off hydrogen gas. It quickly gets smaller and smaller

until it disappears, leaving a strongly alkaline solution (e.g. pH 14) of sodium hydroxide behind:
2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)

Figure 10.10: There is a violent reaction when sodium is placed on a piece of filter paper floating on the surface of
water.

2

By contrast, fresh magnesium reacts extremely slowly with cold water, taking several days to
produce a test-tube of hydrogen gas. The solution formed is very weakly alkaline (e.g. pH 11), as
any magnesium hydroxide formed is only slightly soluble. Therefore, a lower concentration of OH
−(aq) ions enters the solution compared with the result when sodium is added to water. This is
because sodium hydroxide is much more soluble in water than magnesium hydroxide.
Mg(s) + 2H2O(l)

Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)

When heated, magnesium does react vigorously with water in the form of steam to make
magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas:
Mg(s) + H2O(g) → MgO(s) + H2(g)

in which its oxidation number is +1, and Cl2O5, in which its oxidation number is +5.

The maximum oxidation number of each element rises as we cross the period. This happens because the
Period 3 element in each oxide can use all the electrons in its outermost shell in bonding to oxygen (ox. no.
= −2). They all exist in positive oxidation states because oxygen has a higher electronegativity than any of
the Period 3 elements. See Section 12.2 for more about electronegativity.

10.5 Effect of water on oxides and hydroxides of
Period 3 elements
The oxides of sodium and magnesium react with water to form hydroxides. The presence of excess
aqueous hydroxide ions, OH−(aq), makes these solutions alkaline:

Figure 10.11: The basic magnesium oxide or hydroxide reacts with acid in the stomach to form a salt plus water.

Magnesium oxide and magnesium hydroxide are commonly used in indigestion remedies (Figure 10.11).
These basic compounds neutralise excess acid in the stomach, relieving the pain:
MgO(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + H2O(l)
Mg(OH)2(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + 2H2O(l)
Aluminium oxide does not react or dissolve in water, which is why an oxide layer can protect aluminium
metal from corrosion. However, it does react and dissolve when added to acidic or alkaline solutions.
With acid:
Al2O3(s) + 3H2SO4(aq) → Al2(SO4)3(aq) + 3H2O(l)
With hot, concentrated alkali:
Al2O3(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + 3H2O(l) → 2NaAl(OH)4(aq)
When aluminium oxide reacts with an acid it behaves like a base: it forms a salt (aluminium sulfate in the
example with dilute sulfuric acid above) plus water.
When it reacts with an alkali it behaves like an acid: reacting to form a salt (sodium tetrahydroxoaluminate
in the example with sodium hydroxide above).
Compounds that can act as both acids and bases, such as aluminium oxide, are called amphoteric.
Silicon dioxide is also insoluble in water. Water cannot break down its giant molecular structure. However, it
will react with and dissolve in hot, concentrated alkali:
SiO2(s) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na2SiO3(aq) + H2O(l)
Silicon dioxide acts as an acid when it reacts with sodium hydroxide, forming a salt (sodium silicate) plus
water. It does not react with acids, so it is classed as an acidic oxide.
Phosphorus(V) oxide reacts vigorously and dissolves in water to form an acidic solution of phosphoric(V)
acid (pH 2):

P4O10(s) + 6H2O(l) →
The oxides of sulfur, SO2 and SO3, both react and dissolve in water, forming acidic solutions (pH 1):

The effect of bonding and electronegativity on the structure and acidic / basic nature of Period 3 oxides
Table 10.9 shows a summary of the acidic / basic nature of the Period 3 oxides. You need to know this
summary for your examination. We can explain the behaviour of the oxides by looking at their structure
and bonding (Table 10.10 and Figure 10.12).

IMPORTANT
Remember that electronegativity is the power of an atom to attract the electrons in a covalent bond
towards itself. Electronegativity increases across a period and decreases down a group (ignoring the
Group 18 elements).

Going across a period, the elements get more electronegative as electrons are more strongly attracted by
the increasing positive nuclear charge (see Section 4.7). The electronegativity values, which indicate the
strength of the attraction of an atom for the electrons in a bond, are shown in Table 10.11.

IMPORTANT
As we go across Period 3, the structure of the oxides changes from ionic metal oxides (which are basic
oxides) to giant covalent oxides to simple molecular oxides (which are acidic oxides).
The electronegativity of oxygen is 3.5. The greater the difference in electronegativity between the Period 3
element and oxygen, the more likely it is that the oxide will have ionic bonding. Electrons will be
transferred from sodium, magnesium and aluminium atoms (forming positively charged ions) to oxygen
atoms (forming O2− ions) when their oxides are formed. The other Period 3 elements will form covalently
bonded oxides in which bonding electrons are shared.
Notice the high melting points of the giant ionic and giant covalent structures, leading to the use of:
magnesium oxide to line the inside of furnaces
aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide to make ceramics, with giant covalent structures designed to
withstand high temperatures and provide electrical insulation.
The oxides of the metals sodium and magnesium, with purely ionic bonding, produce alkaline solutions with
water as their oxide ions, O2−(aq), become hydroxide ions, OH−(aq). The oxide ions behave as bases by
accepting H+ ions from water molecules:
O2−(aq) + H2O(l) → 2OH−(aq)
By contrast, the covalently bonded non-metal oxides of phosphorus and sulfur dissolve and react in water
to form acidic solutions. The acid molecules formed donate H+ ions to water molecules, behaving as typical
acids. For example, sulfuric(VI) acid:
H2SO4(aq) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + HSO4(aq)
The insoluble oxides of aluminium and silicon show their acidic nature by reacting and dissolving in an
alkaline solution, such as hot, concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, forming a soluble salt. This
behaviour is typical of a covalently bonded oxide. However, aluminium oxide also reacts and dissolves in
acidic solutions, forming a soluble salt: behaviour typical of a basic metal oxide with ionic bonding.
Because aluminium oxide behaves in these two ways, this provides evidence that the chemical bonding in
aluminium oxide is not purely ionic nor purely covalent. It is amphoteric.

10.6 Chlorides of Period 3 elements
Oxidation numbers of the Period 3 chlorides
Table 10.12 shows the formulae of the common chlorides of the Period 3 elements.
The oxidation numbers rise as we cross Period 3, until we reach sulfur in Group 16. This happens because
the Period 3 elements from sodium to phosphorus use all the electrons in their outermost shell, their
valence electrons, in bonding to chlorine (ox. no. = −1). They all exist in positive oxidation states because
chlorine has a higher electronegativity than any of the other Period 3 elements (see Table 10.12).

10.7 Effect of water on chlorides of Period 3

Table 10.13: The structure and bonding of the chlorides of Period 3 elements and the effect of water on these chlorides.

At the start of Period 3, the ionic chlorides of sodium (NaCl) and magnesium (MgCl2) do not react with
water. The polar water molecules are attracted to the ions, dissolving the chlorides by breaking down the
giant ionic structures. The solutions formed contain the positive metal ions and the negative chloride ions
surrounded by water molecules. The metal ions and the chloride ions are called hydrated ions:
NaCl(s)

Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq)

Aluminium chloride is sometimes represented as AlCl3, which suggests that its chemical bonding is likely to
be ionic: with Al3+ ions and Cl− ions in a giant lattice. In solid hydrated aluminium chloride crystals, this is
the case. However, without water it exists as Al2Cl6. This can be thought of as a dimer (two molecules
joined together) of AlCl3. Al2Cl6 is a covalently bonded molecule (see Figure 10.13).

Figure 10.13: The chemical bonding in Al2Cl6.

IMPORTANT
As we go across Period 3, the structures of the chlorides change from ionic metal chlorides (which are
neutral) to metallic chlorides (which can be hydrolysed by water to form acids as one of the products)
to simple molecular chlorides (which form acids when added to water).
Once we add water, the dimers are broken down and aluminium ions and chloride ions enter the solution.

Each relatively small and highly charged Al3+ ion is hydrated and causes a water molecule bonded to it to
lose an H+ ion. This turns the solution acidic. We can show this in an equation as follows:
[Al(H2O)6 ]3+(aq) → [Al(H2O)5OH]2+(aq) + H+(aq)
The non-metal chlorides SiCl4 and PCl5 are hydrolysed in water, releasing white fumes of hydrogen chloride
gas in a rapid reaction (Figure 10.14).
SiCl4(l) + 2H2O(l) → SiO2(s) + 4HCl(g)
The SiO2 is seen as an off-white precipitate. Some of the hydrogen chloride gas produced dissolves in the
water, leaving an acidic solution (hydrochloric acid).
Phosphorus(V) chloride also undergoes hydrolysis when added to water:
PCl5(s) + 4H2O(l) → H3PO4(aq) + 5HCl(g)
Both products are soluble in water and are highly acidic.

Figure 10.14: Solid phosphorus(V) chloride is hydrolysed in water, releasing white fumes of hydrogen chloride gas.

10.8 Deducing the position of an element in the
Periodic Table
We can deduce the possible position of an element in the Periodic Table by looking at its physical and
chemical properties. We can also predict, as Mendeleev did, the physical and chemical properties of an
element in a given group if we know its position. In the worked examples given, note there are several
ways of arriving at the same conclusion.

WORKED EXAMPLES
1

Element G forms a chloride, which reacts with water to form a solution of pH 1. It forms an oxide
which has a melting point of 1610 °C. The oxide does not dissolve in or react with aqueous sodium
hydroxide. Deduce the possible position of G in the Periodic Table.

Solution
Step 1:

Use the pH data to decide whether G is likely to be a metal or non-metal.
Low pH suggests that it is a metal chloride which undergoes hydrolysis, so is likely to be
in Group 13 to 17.

Step 2:

Use the solubility data.
The oxide doesn’t dissolve in sodium hydroxide. This rules out aluminium oxide because
this reacts with sodium hydroxide. So G could be a giant covalent structure or simple
molecular structure.

Step 3:

Use melting point data.
The melting point is high so it is likely to be a giant covalent structure in Group 14.

Step 4:
2

It cannot be in Period 2 because CO2 is a gas. So it could be in Period 3 or lower.

Selenium is in Group 16 and Period 4 of the Periodic Table. Predict some physical and chemical
properties of selenium.
Step 1:

Identify the likely structure of selenium from its position in the Periodic Table and
comparison with other Group 16 elements.
It’s a non-metal in Group 16 so comparing with sulfur it should have a simple molecular
structure.

Step 2:

Identify the physical properties related to the structure.
Simple molecular structures have (relatively) low melting points, do not conduct
electricity and are insoluble in water.

Step 3:

Identify the chemical properties related to reaction with water, reaction with chlorine
and reaction with oxygen.
Simple molecules do not react with water.
Reacts with chlorine to form simple molecule SeCl4 (which reacts with water vapour in
the air to produce hydrogen chloride).
Reacts with oxygen to form an oxide of possible formula SeO2 (by comparison with
sulfur).

The chloride of an unknown element Y is a solid at 20 °C. This chloride does not react with water

of the Periodic Table?

SUMMARY
As you go across a period in the Periodic Table, there are variations in physical properties such as ionisation
energies, atomic radii, ionic radii, melting points and electrical conductivities.
Atomic radii decrease across a period due to increasing nuclear charge.
Across the period, the structures of the elements change from giant metallic, through giant molecular to simple
molecular. Group 18 elements consist of individual atoms.
Across the period, the oxides of Period 3 elements change from basic compounds with ionic bonding through to
giant molecular in the centre of the period (Group 14) with silicon, going on to acidic covalently bonded simple
molecules of the non-metal oxides. Aluminium oxide (in Group 13) is amphoteric, exhibiting both basic and acidic
behaviour.
Across the period, the chlorides of Period 3 elements change from ionic compounds that dissolve in water to
covalent compounds that are hydrolysed by water, releasing fumes of hydrogen chloride and leaving an acidic
solution.

Working as a pair, one person explains to the other how a magnesium ion is formed from a
magnesium atom. Then the other person explains the formation of an oxide ion. Finally discuss
together how the ions form ionic bonds in the compound, magnesium oxide.

SOME USES OF GROUP 2 COMPOUNDS
Elements from Group 2 are used in a range of applications. For example, Group 2 metals produce
coloured flames when heated, leading to their use in flares and fireworks. Magnesium in its powdered
form is used in flares. The large surface area in a fine powder increases the rate of reaction with
oxygen.
In military aircraft, the heat given off from decoy magnesium flares confuses the Infrared detection
systems in heat-seeking missiles (Figure 11.1). The missiles cannot focus in and target the aircraft.
The compounds of Group 2 elements are used even more widely than the elements themselves. Most
useful is calcium carbonate, CaCO3. It is found in the many types of limestone, which provide useful
rocks for building. The limestone rock itself can be shaped into blocks that builders can bind to each
other using mortar. Marble is another form of calcium carbonate used as a building material, for
example to make expensive tiles.

Figure 11.1: A military plane releasing its decoy flares to protect itself from missile attack.

However, most calcium carbonate is used to make cement. The first stage in the manufacture of
cement is the roasting of limestone in a lime kiln (see Figure 11.2).

Figure 11.2: In a rotating lime kiln, calcium carbonate undergoes thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide and
carbon dioxide.

At the high temperatures in the kiln, calcium carbonate decomposes to form calcium oxide (also called
lime or quicklime):

The calcium oxide made in the lime kiln is roasted with clay to make cement. Cement can be mixed
with sand and small pieces of rock to make concrete, the most widely used building material in the
world. Builders improve its strength by including iron rods, which run through the concrete.
Farmers use slaked lime (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2) to raise the pH of acidic soil. Calcium hydroxide
is basic, so it will react with and neutralise acid, raising the pH of the soil.

Questions for discussion
1

Limestone rock is mined from huge quarries before being taken to lime kilns to be roasted. In a
small group, discuss some environmental impacts of using the world’s most common building
material, concrete.

2

When lightning strikes during a thunderstorm, the rain that falls is a dilute solution of nitric acid
(HNO3). Work with a partner to write a balanced chemical equation, including state symbols, to
show how slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) added to soil can neutralise nitric acid.

3

Justify which is the more important use of a Group 2 compound: making concrete or raising the pH
of soil.

11.1 Physical properties of Group 2 elements
We sometimes refer to the elements in Group 2 of the Periodic Table as the alkaline earth metals. As the
elements are in Group 2, they have atoms whose electronic configurations end with two electrons in their
outermost principal quantum shell. These two outer electrons occupy an s sub-shell.
Here are the electronic configurations of the first five elements in Group 2:
Beryllium (Be)

1s2 2s2

Magnesium (Mg)

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2

Calcium (Ca)

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2

Strontium (Sr)

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p6 5s2

Barium (Ba)

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p6 4d10 5s2 5p6 6s2

One way of describing the size of an atom is its metallic radius. The metallic radius is half the distance
between the nuclei in a giant metallic lattice (Figure 11.3). See Section 10.2 for other measures that
describe the size of atoms.

Figure 11.3: The metallic radius gives us a measure of the size of the atoms of metallic elements.

Look at the metallic radii of the Group 2 elements measured in nanometres, shown in Table 11.1.

magnesium (Mg)

Table 11.1: The metallic radii of the Group 2 elements. (1 nm = 1 × 10−9 m).

Can you see the trend? The atoms of Group 2 elements get larger going down the group. This is because the
outer two electrons occupy a new principal quantum shell that is further away from the nucleus.
There are also general trends in other physical properties, such as melting point and density, shown in Table
11.2 and displayed in Figures 11.4 and 11.5.

REFLECTION
Do you enjoy spotting trends in data or do you find expressing trends difficult? How about applying your
knowledge of the trends within a group to make predictions about the properties of a particular
element? Are there any aspects of these skills that you find difficult? If so, discuss these with another
student, then seek advice if you are still unsure.

11.2 Reactions of Group 2 elements
The Group 2 metals form ionic compounds. When they react, their atoms lose the two electrons from their
outermost s sub-shell and form an ion with the stable electronic configuration of a noble gas. This creates a
2+ ion. For example, in the ionisation of a magnesium atom to a magnesium ion:

The metals act as reducing agents. Their atoms donate (give away) electrons and so they are oxidised
themselves as they react to form their 2+ ions. The ionisation energies shown in Table 11.3 show how
easily the two outer electrons are removed from the Group 2 atoms.

Table 11.3: The first and second ionisation energies of the Group 2 elements.

The metals in Group 2 get more reactive as we go down the group. As you can see from Table 11.3, it takes
less energy (i.e. it gets easier) to remove the pair of outer electrons going down Group 2. So, although the
positive charge on the nucleus increases down the group:
the greater shielding effect provided by extra inner shells of electrons, and
the larger distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus outweigh the attraction of the higher
nuclear charge.
This helps to explain the increase in reactivity going down the group, as it gets easier for the atoms to form
their 2+ ions.

IMPORTANT
The Group 2 elements get more reactive going down the group.
This trend is shown by looking at reactions of the Group 2 metals, magnesium to barium, with dilute
hydrochloric acid. The metals react with dilute hydrochloric acid, forming a solution of the metal chloride
and giving off hydrogen gas.
For example:
Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)
Ca(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl2(aq) + H2(g)
The reactions get more vigorous descending the group. You can see this by the increasing rate at which
bubbles of hydrogen gas are given off.
Magnesium reacts in a similar way with dilute sulfuric acid:
Mg(s) + H2SO4(aq) → MgSO4(aq) + H2(g)
However, any reaction with calcium, strontium or barium is quickly stopped by the formation of an
insoluble sulfate layer on the surface of the metals. For example, you can see a slow stream of hydrogen
bubbles for a short time when a pellet (small piece) of calcium metal is dropped into dilute sulfuric acid:
Ca(s) + H2SO4(aq) → CaSO4(s) + H2(g)
The calcium gets then gets completely covered by a layer sparingly soluble calcium sulfate and the

bubbles of hydrogen stop rising from the metal.
Strontium sulfate and barium sulfate are even less soluble than calcium sulfate so will quickly stop any
reaction with the metals strontium and barium.

IMPORTANT
The Group 2 sulfates get less soluble going down the group.

Discuss the trend shown on your graph and how this might affect the reactivity of the Group 2
elements.

11.3 Reactions with oxygen
The Group 2 metals burn in air, and burn more rapidly in oxygen gas. The metals form white solid oxides.
For example, magnesium ribbon burns with a bright white flame once it is ignited in a Bunsen flame (Figure
11.6):
2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)
The magnesium oxide formed is basic in character, as shown in Section 10.5.
The Group 2 metals get more reactive with oxygen going down the group. The larger atoms lose their outer
two electrons more readily than the smaller atoms in the group. The reasons for this are given below Table
11.3.

Figure 11.6: Magnesium ribbon reacting with oxygen in the air.

Barium metal is so highly reactive that it must be stored under oil to keep it out of contact with air.
Some of the Group 2 metals burn with characteristic flame colours. In the heat of the Bunsen burner flame,
the metal atoms are oxidised, losing two electrons, and forming their positive ions. The oxidation number
of the metal atoms (0) increases to the +2 state in the process. It is the 2+ ions formed in the reaction that
cause the characteristic colours you can see in the Bunsen burner flame.

Flame tests
We can test for calcium, strontium and barium ions in compounds using flame tests (Figure 11.7). A
nichrome wire, cleaned with concentrated hydrochloric acid, is dipped into a sample of the salt to be tested
and heated in a non-luminous Bunsen flame:
calcium compounds give a brick-red colour
strontium compounds give a scarlet/red colour
barium compounds give an apple-green colour.

Figure 11.7: The flame colours of calcium, strontium and barium.

Reactions of oxides with dilute acid
The basic oxides of the Group 2 metals can be neutralised by dilute acid. The general equation for the
reaction of a basic oxide is:
basic oxide + dilute acid → a salt + water
For example:
MgO(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + H2O(l)
The white magnesium oxide powder dissolves, forming a colourless solution of magnesium chloride, as it
reacts with the dilute acid. The oxides of calcium (CaO), strontium (SrO) and barium (BaO) are also
neutralised by dilute hydrochloric acid.
A similar reaction occurs when excess dilute sulfuric acid is added to the Group 2 oxides, but a sulfate
solution is formed:
MgO(s) + H2SO4(aq) → MgSO4(aq) + H2O(l)
With dilute sulfuric acid, the decreasing solubility of the sulfate formed going down the group will also
affect the neutralisation reaction with dilute sulfuric acid. The insoluble sulfates will form at the surface of
the oxides, protecting any solid oxide beneath. However, when the oxide is in the form of a powder and
stirred, significant neutralisation can occur.

11.4 Reactions with water
We have seen in Section 10.3 how magnesium reacts very slowly with cold water (Figure 11.8). However, if
left long enough, the reaction will eventually form a weakly alkaline solution, and give off enough hydrogen
to test:
Mg(s) + 2H2O(l) → Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)

Figure 11.8: Cleaned with sandpaper, magnesium ribbon reacts very, very slowly with water at room temperature.

Hot magnesium does react vigorously with water in the form of steam. The magnesium and steam produce
magnesium oxide (a white solid) and hydrogen gas (see Figure 11.9):
Mg(s) + H2O(g) → MgO(s) + H2(g)
Calcium reacts more readily than magnesium with water at room temperature:
Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)
This reaction gives off a steady stream of hydrogen gas and forms a cloudy white suspension of slightly
soluble calcium hydroxide. The calcium hydroxide that does dissolve forms a solution that we call
‘limewater’, which makes the solution weakly alkaline.
Going down the group, hydrogen gas is released more and more rapidly by the reaction of the Group 2
metal with water (see Figure 11.10).

Figure 11.9: An experiment showing magnesium reacting with steam. The steam is given off from mineral wool soaked in
water at the right-hand end of the test-tube. The white magnesium oxide formed is visible inside the test-tube. The
hydrogen gas produced in the reaction has been ignited at the end of the straight tube.

Figure 11.10: Barium reacting vigorously with water, forming alkaline barium hydroxide solution and giving off hydrogen
gas.

Reactions of Group 2 oxides and water
Magnesium oxide is only slightly soluble in water, and forms a weakly alkaline solution of magnesium
hydroxide. A saturated solution of magnesium hydroxide will have a pH value of about 10:
MgO(s) + H2O(l) → Mg(OH)2(aq)
Calcium oxide, CaO, reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide. When water is dripped onto the surface
of a lump of calcium oxide it causes a vigorous reaction. It releases so much energy that some of the water
boils off as the solid lump appears to expand, and cracks open:
CaO(s) + H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(s)
In excess water, some of the slightly soluble calcium hydroxide dissolves to form a weakly alkaline solution,
with a slightly higher pH than magnesium hydroxide. The higher concentration of aqueous hydroxide ions
in a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide solution result in its pH of about 11:
Ca(OH)2(s)

Ca2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq)

In general, the reaction and dissolving of the Group 2 metal oxides in water is described by the following
ionic equation:
O2−(s) + H2O(l) → 2OH−(aq)

IMPORTANT
The solutions formed from the reactions of the Group 2 metal oxides with water get more alkaline
going down the group.
We can explain this increase in alkalinity by looking at the solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides formed (see
Table 11.4).

Group 2 hydroxide, general formula X(OH)2

Solubility of hydroxide at 298 K
(mol / 100 g of water)

3.4 × 10−3

barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)2

1.5 × 10−2

Table 11.4: Solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides in water.

IMPORTANT
The solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides increases going down Group 2.
Therefore, when adding and stirring magnesium hydroxide in water to make a saturated solution, then
doing the same with barium hydroxide, there will be a higher concentration of hydroxide ions in the
saturated barium hydroxide solution. This higher concentration of hydroxide ions results in a higher pH
value for the barium hydroxide solution.

Reactions of hydroxides with dilute acid
The alkaline hydroxides of the Group 2 metals will all be neutralised by dilute acid:
hydroxide + dilute acid → a salt + water
For example, with magnesium hydroxide powder and dilute hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid:
Mg(OH)2(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + 2H2O(l)
Mg(OH)2(s) + H2SO4(aq) → MgSO4(aq) + 2H2O(l)
or with barium hydroxide solution:
Ba(OH)2(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → BaCl2(aq) + 2H2O(l)
Ba(OH)2(aq) + H2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)
The barium sulfate forms as a white precipitate, unlike the soluble barium chloride (a colourless solution).

ones you have covered first of all.

Then make a list of those outcomes you feel uncertain about.

3

Discuss your list with another student and talk about any issues you can sort out together. Make a
list of specific questions for your teacher to help you with any unresolved problems you may have.

Reactions of Group 2 carbonates
The Group 2 carbonates have the general formula XCO3. The carbonates of magnesium, calcium, strontium
and barium are all insoluble in water.
However, the carbonates all react in dilute acid, forming a salt and water and giving off carbon dioxide gas.
For example, with dilute sulfuric acid:
MgCO3(s) + H2SO4(aq) → MgSO4(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
The magnesium sulfate salt formed in the reaction above is soluble in water. This remains in aqueous
solution, and no solid carbonate will remain in excess dilute sulfuric acid.
However, the sulfates of the other Group 2 elements are much less soluble than magnesium sulfate.
Remember the decreasing trend in the solubility of the sulfates described in Section 11.2. So the sulfates of
calcium, strontium and barium tend to form as an insoluble sulfate layer on their solid carbonates. This
stops any further reaction after the initial effervescence (bubbling) of carbon dioxide gas is seen.
For example:
BaCO3(s) + H2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
The reactions of the Group 2 carbonates with dilute hydrochloric acid will all form soluble chloride salts,
water and carbon dioxide gas.
For example:
BaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) → BaCl2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)

Thermal decomposition of Group 2 carbonates and nitrates
The carbonates and nitrates of the Group 2 elements decompose when heated. The carbonates break
down to form the metal oxide and give off carbon dioxide gas. For example:
MgCO3(s)

MgO(s) + CO2(g)

The temperature at which thermal decomposition of the Group 2 carbonates takes place increases going
down Group 2.
The Group 2 nitrates also undergo thermal decomposition.
For example:
2Ca(NO3)2(s)

2CaO(s) + 4NO2(g) + O2(g)

A brown gas is observed when a Group 2 nitrate is heated. This is toxic nitrogen dioxide, NO2 (nitrogen(IV)
oxide).

IMPORTANT
As with the carbonates, a higher temperature is needed to thermally decompose the nitrates as Group
2 is descended.
You can read an explanation of the trend in the thermal stability of the Group 2 carbonates and nitrates in
Section 19.3.

SUMMARY
Going down Group 2 from magnesium to barium, the atomic radius increases. This is due to the addition of an extra
principal quantum shell of electrons for the atoms of each element as the group is descended.
The Group 2 elements, magnesium to barium, react with water to produce hydrogen gas and the metal hydroxide,
which may be only slightly soluble.
The Group 2 elements, magnesium to barium, burn in air to form white solid oxides. These oxides form hydroxides
with water. The hydroxides get more soluble in water going down the group so their solutions can become more
alkaline.
The sulfates of Group 2 elements get less soluble in water going down the group.
Reactivity of the elements with oxygen or water increases going down Group 2, as the first and second ionisation
energies decrease. Therefore it becomes easier to remove electrons from the atoms descending Group 2.
The Group 2 carbonates and nitrates get more resistant to thermal decomposition descending the group.

USES OF THE HALOGENS AND THEIR COMPOUNDS
People have not always used the halogens and their compounds to benefit society. For example,
chlorine was used as the first chemical weapon in the First World War (1914–18). Its compounds can
also be used in biological nerve gases, though this use is banned by international agreement.
However, scientists can use chlorine to kill bacteria in drinking water (Figure 12.1). This saves millions
of lives around the world. It has greatly reduced the number of cases of cholera, but about 25 000
people still die world-wide every day from diseases spread in water.
Many pesticides containing halogen atoms have reduced deaths caused by disease-carrying insects.
Malaria is the main disease. These pesticides also reduce the loss of crops in storage. However, these
halogen compounds can have bad effects on other wildlife in the food chain.
Halogen compounds have also damaged the Earth’s ozone layer. This thin layer of gas in the upper
atmosphere absorbs harmful ultra-violet rays from the Sun. The halogen compounds called CFCs
(chlorofluorocarbons) are very unreactive and people once thought they were completely harmless to
living things. So CFCs were used in aerosols and as coolants in fridges.

Figure 12.1: Chlorine may be added to drinking water to kill harmful microorganisms.

Then, scientists in the 1980s discovered a hole in our protective ozone layer caused by CFCs reacting
with ozone: and the hole was growing. This meant that people would have a greater risk of getting skin
cancer and eye cataracts. Because of this, CFCs are now banned, as are other halogen compounds
that were used in fire extinguishers, flame-proofing and solvents. Scientists are now using new
compounds instead of CFCs. There is evidence that the hole in the ozone layer is gradually getting
smaller. You can find out more detail on the environmental effect of CFCs at the start of Chapter 16.

Question for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Do you believe that the uses of halogens and their compounds have had a positive or negative
effect on the world, overall?

12.1 Physical properties of Group 17 elements
In this chapter we are looking at the elements in Group 17 of the Periodic Table. These are called the
halogens. Their atoms all have seven electrons in the outer principal quantum shell.
Here are the electronic configurations of the first four elements in Group 17:
fluorine (F)

1s2 2s2 2p5

chlorine (Cl)

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p5

bromine (Br)

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p5

iodine (I)

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p6 4d10 5s2 5p5

The Group 17 elements are all non-metals. At room temperature, they exist as diatomic molecules, i.e.
molecules made up of two atoms, F2, Cl2, Br2 and I2. There is a single covalent bond between the two
atoms in each molecule. You can see the elements chlorine, bromine and iodine in Figure 12.2.

Figure 12.2: Three of the Group 17 elements, known as the halogens. Notice that the colour of the elements gets darker
going down the group.

Table 12.1 shows some of the physical properties of the halogens.

Table 12.1: Some physical properties of the Group 17 elements. The atomic radius value is taken from single
covalent data (see Section 4.3).

Looking at Table 12.1, you can see that the melting points and boiling points of the halogens increase going
down the group. The boiling point data gives us an idea of the volatility of the halogens, i.e. the ease with
which they evaporate. All the values are relatively low because they have simple molecular structures.
There are only weak van der Waals’ forces between their diatomic molecules, caused by instantaneous
dipole–induced dipole forces. These forces increase as the number of electrons in the molecules increases
with increasing atomic number. The greater the number of electrons, the greater the opportunities for
instantaneous dipoles arising within molecules, and for induced dipoles to be produced on neighbouring
molecules. The larger the molecules, the stronger the van der Waals’ forces between molecules. This
makes iodine the least volatile and fluorine the most volatile of the halogens you are learning about.
You can also see that the colours of the halogens get darker going down the group.

12.2 Reactions of Group 17 elements
The halogen atoms need to gain just one more electron to achieve the stable electronic configuration of
the noble gas atoms to the right of them in the Periodic Table. Therefore, halogens react with metallic
elements, with each of their atoms gaining one electron from atoms of the metal, to become ions with a 1−
charge.
For example:
Ca(s) + Cl2(g) → Ca2+(Cl−)2(s)
When a halogen reacts with a metal atom, the halogen atom gains one electron. Because of this, the
halogen elements are oxidising agents (electron acceptors). In the process of oxidising another substance,
the elements themselves are reduced. Their oxidation number is reduced from 0 in the element to −1 in
the compound formed.

The halogens also react with many non-metals. Each halogen atom shares a pair of electrons with the other
non-metal atom in a covalent bond, e.g. in hydrogen chloride, HCl.
H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)
We can repeat the reactions of chlorine with calcium and with hydrogen (shown here) with the other
halogens. In these experiments we find that the reactions of fluorine are more vigorous than those of
chlorine. Bromine reacts less vigorously than chlorine, and iodine is less reactive than bromine.

IMPORTANT
The halogens get less reactive going down Group 17.
Electronegativity is the ability of a covalently bonded atom to attract the bonding pair of electrons towards
itself (see Section 4.7). This pattern in reactivity corresponds to the trend in electronegativity going down
the group, shown in Table 12.2.
A fluorine atom has the strongest pull on the pair of electrons in a covalent bond, while an iodine atom has
the weakest attraction for electrons. We can explain this by looking at the atomic radii data in Table 12.1.
The fluorine atom is the smallest in the group. Its outer shell is nearer to the attractive force of the nucleus
and an electron entering its outer shell will also experience the least shielding from the attraction of the
positive nuclear charge.

These factors outweigh the fact that fluorine’s nuclear charge is only 9+ compared with iodine’s 53+.
Therefore, fluorine is a much stronger oxidising agent (acceptor of electrons) than iodine.

Question

a

In a small group, discuss in detail why chlorine is more reactive than bromine.

b

Design and produce a poster to illustrate your answer to part a to the rest of the class.

Evidence for the oxidising power of the halogens
We can also judge the relative reactivity (or the oxidising power) of the halogens by looking at their
displacement reactions with other halide ions in solution.

IMPORTANT
A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from a halide solution of the less reactive
halogen.
Let’s look at an example. When chlorine water, Cl2(aq), is added to a solution of sodium bromide containing
Br−(aq) ions, the solution changes to a yellowish-brown colour. The colour is caused by the presence of
dissolved bromine molecules, Br2(aq), as found in bromine water. The displacement reaction that takes
place is:
Cl2(aq) + 2NaBr(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + Br2(aq)
We say that chlorine has displaced bromine from solution.
This is summarised in the ionic equation for this displacement reaction:
Cl2(aq) + 2Br−(aq) → 2Cl−(aq) + Br2(aq)
The chlorine atoms are more electronegative than bromine atoms so are more likely (have a stronger
tendency) to form negatively charged ions.
Likewise, bromine will displace iodine from an iodide solution:
Br2(aq) + 2NaI(aq) → 2NaBr(aq) + I2(aq)
or as an ionic equation:
Br2(aq) + 2I−(aq) → 2Br−(aq) + I2(aq)

IMPORTANT
These displacement reactions show that the oxidising power of the halogens (their ability to gain
electrons) decreases going down Group 17.
The colours of the halogen molecules in solution are difficult to identify positively in these displacement
experiments. However, the halogens (Cl2, Br2 and I2) dissolve well in the colourless liquid, cyclohexane
(which is immiscible in water, forming two separate layers). The halogens dissolved in cyclohexane are
clearly different colours.
Therefore, you can add some of this organic solvent after mixing the halogen / halide solutions, shaking the
mixture. Then allow the reaction mixture to settle into two layers, showing clearly which halogen is present
as its diatomic molecules (see Figure 12.3).

Figure 12.3: Cyclohexane forms a layer on top of water. Dissolved chlorine is very pale green in this upper organic layer,
bromine is orange and iodine is purple.

solutions.

Discuss with a partner to decide how confident you are at constructing ionic equations, as in part
b in Question 3 above.

Can you draw conclusions from your observations of the experiments?

Now reflect on what you have discussed above and write a series of steps for constructing ionic
equations.

Reactions of halogens with hydrogen
The halogens form hydrogen halides when combined with hydrogen gas.
One example of this is the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine to give hydrogen chloride gas. The trend in
reactivity is illustrated by their reactions in Table 12.3.
Equation for reaction

Description of reaction

H2(g) + F2(g) → 2HF(g)

H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)

H2(g) + Br2(g) → 2HBr(g)

reacts slowly on heating

H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)

forms an equilibrium mixture on heating

Table 12.3: The reactions of hydrogen and the halogens, showing decreasing reactivity going down Group 17.

The hydrogen halides formed differ in their thermal stability. Hydrogen iodide can be decomposed by
inserting a red-hot wire into a sample of hydrogen iodide gas. The purple fumes seen are iodine vapour:
2HI(g) → H2(g) + I2(g)
By contrast, hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride are not decomposed in temperatures up to 1500 °C.
Hydrogen bromide is not as stable as HF and HCl, but it is more resistant to decomposition than hydrogen
iodide. At 430 °C in a closed container, 10% of a sample of HBr will decompose, whereas around 20% of HI
decomposes at that temperature.

IMPORTANT
The hydrogen halides get less thermally stable going down Group 17.

We can explain this trend by looking at the bond strengths as shown by bond energies in Table 12.4.

Table 12.4: Hydrogen–halogen bond energies.

As you can see in Table 12.4, the bond energies decrease going down Group 17, making it easier to break
the hydrogen–halogen bond. This is because the iodine atom is the largest atom. The overlap of its outer
shell with a hydrogen atom gives a much longer bond length than with the other smaller halogen atoms.
The longer the bond, the weaker it is, and the less energy required to break it. For this reason, HI is less
thermally stable than HF.

12.3 Reactions of the halide ions
In this section, we consider the reactions of the negatively charged halide ions formed by the halogens.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 12.1
Testing for halide ions
We can identify the halide ions, Cl−(aq), Br−(aq) and I−(aq), by using simple chemical tests. If an
unknown compound is dissolved in dilute nitric acid and silver nitrate solution is added, a precipitate
will form if the unknown solution contains halide ions. The precipitate will be silver chloride (AgCl),
silver bromide (AgBr) or silver iodide (AgI) (see Figure 12.4).
These precipitates are similar in colour. We can then use a further test to help us distinguish one
precipitate from another. We can add ammonia solution – dilute ammonia solution followed by
concentrated ammonia solution – to verify the result. The results of the tests are shown in Table 12.5.
The general equation for the precipitation reaction with silver nitrate solution is:
AgNO3(aq) + X−(aq) → AgX(s) + NO3−(aq)
where X− represents the halide ion.
The nitrate ions can be left out to produce the ionic equation. They are called ‘spectator ions’, i.e. ions
that do not get involved in the reaction:

IMPORTANT
Ag+(aq) + X−(aq) → AgX(s)
The ammonia can form complex ions that are soluble in water when added to:
silver chloride, as it forms soluble complex ions with dilute ammonia
silver bromide, as it forms soluble complex ions with concentrated ammonia.
Silver iodide precipitate does not dissolve on adding dilute or concentrated ammonia solution.

Reactions of halide ions with concentrated sulfuric acid
Compounds that contain Cl−, Br− or I− ions will react with concentrated sulfuric acid. All of these reactions
produce one or more toxic gases, so they must be performed with great care in a fume cupboard.
We can prepare hydrogen chloride gas by dropping concentrated sulfuric acid slowly onto crystals of
sodium chloride (see the apparatus in Figure 12.5).

Figure 12.5: Preparing a sample of hydrogen chloride gas. Hydrogen chloride gas is denser than air, so it displaces the air
from the gas jar as it collects.

The reaction that takes place is:
NaCl(s) + H2SO4(l) → NaHSO4(s) + HCl(g)
The hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas produced is visible as white fumes.
However, we cannot use the same reaction to prepare samples of pure hydrogen bromide or hydrogen
iodide. We saw in Section 12.2 how it gets increasingly easy to decompose the hydrogen halides going
down the group.
When the hydrogen halides decompose into their elements, the halide part of the molecule in HBr and HI is
oxidised. Concentrated sulfuric acid is a relatively strong oxidising agent. It is not strong enough to oxidise
HCl, but concentrated sulfuric acid will oxidise and decompose HBr and HI. So, any HBr or HI formed in the
reaction between sodium bromide, or sodium iodide, and concentrated sulfuric acid undergoes further
oxidation.
With sodium bromide, hydrogen bromide is produced in the initial reaction:
NaBr(s) + H2SO4(l) → NaHSO4(s) + HBr(g)
This is followed by oxidation of HBr(g). The sulfuric acid itself is reduced to sulfur dioxide gas as it oxidises
the HBr formed:
2HBr(g) + H2SO4(l) → Br2(g) + SO2(g) + 2H2O(l)
A reddish brown gas is seen. This is the element bromine, Br2.
With sodium iodide, the sulfuric acid is reduced to several sulfur products as it oxidises the hydrogen iodide
formed to different extents. The products of the oxidation of HI are sulfur dioxide, sulfur and hydrogen
sulfide, as shown in the reactions below:
NaI(s) + H2SO4(l) → NaHSO4(s) + HI(g)
followed by oxidation of HI(g):
2HI(g) + H2SO4(l) → I2(g) + SO2(g) + 2H2O(l)
and:
6HI(g) + H2SO4(l) → 3I2(g) + S(s) + 4H2O(l)
and:
8HI(g) + H2SO4(l) → 4I2(g) + H2S(g) + 4H2O(l)
Several observations can be made here:
sulfur is seen as a yellow solid
hydrogen sulfide has a strong smell of bad eggs
iodine is produced as a violet / purple vapour.

Therefore, NaBr or NaI produce a mixture of gases when they react with concentrated sulfuric acid, so this
is not a good way to prepare a sample of the gases HBr or HI.

IMPORTANT
It gets easier to oxidise the hydrogen halides going down Group 17.
In the reactions above, the bromide ions (Br−) in HBr, and the iodide ions (I−) in HI, act as reducing agents.
The bromide and iodide ions are electron donors. As they reduce the sulfuric acid, their oxidation numbers
increase from −1 to 0 (zero) and bromide and iodide ions are oxidised.

Question
5

a

You suspect that a solid compound might be potassium bromide. Describe how you would test
your idea. Then describe the positive results you would get if you were correct.

b

i

Working with a partner, discuss what you would see in a test-tube in which concentrated
sulfuric acid is added dropwise to solid potassium iodide that you would not see if the acid
was added to potassium chloride.

ii

Write equations, including state symbols, to describe the reactions taking place in the testtube between concentrated sulfuric acid and potassium iodide. Check your equations
against those of another pair of learners. Are the reactants and products and their formulae
correct? Are their state symbols correct? Do the equations balance?

c

Decide with your partner which one of the following ions is the strongest reducing agent:
A

fluoride

B

chloride

C

bromide

D

iodide

Discuss together why that ion would be the best electron donor of the four ions in terms of ionic
radius and shielding of the nuclear charge. Then write an answer that also considers the size of
the charge carried by the nuclei of the ions.

IMPORTANT
The halide ions are increasingly effective as reducing agents going down Group 17.

12.4 Disproportionation reactions
The element chlorine (Cl2, oxidation number = 0) undergoes a type of redox reaction called
disproportionation when it reacts with alkali. We can think of disproportionation as a ‘self-reduction /
oxidation’ reaction. When chlorine reacts with dilute alkali, some chlorine atoms are reduced and some are
oxidised in the same reaction. The actual reaction that takes place depends on the temperature.

Chlorine in cold alkali (15 °C)
The ionic equation for the reaction is:

The ionic equation for this redox reaction can be split into two half-equations, showing the reduction and
oxidation.
The reduction reaction (in which chlorine’s oxidation number is reduced is):

The oxidation reaction taking place at the same time is:

Chlorine in hot alkali (70 °C)
When we add chlorine and hot concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide a different disproportionation
reaction takes place:

Chlorination of water
Adding a small amount of chlorine to a water supply will kill bacteria and make the water safer to drink.
The chlorine undergoes disproportionation in water:

HClO is called chloric(I) acid. It sterilises water by killing bacteria. Some of the HClO dissociates in water to
produce ClO−(aq), which also acts as a sterilising agent.

Can you describe the colours of, and explain the trend in volatility of, the Group 17 elements
chlorine, bromine and iodine?

b

Make a list of the key words in this chapter and discuss their meaning with another learner.

Work with another learner to reflect on the importance of using oxidation numbers in

understanding the reactions of Group 17 elements and their compounds. Try to use changes in
oxidation state to judge which species in a redox reaction is oxidised and which is reduced.

Discuss which parts of this chapter you enjoyed most, and which, if any, you still feel unsure
about. You can use the checklist after the Summary to help you to decide.

SUMMARY
The halogens chlorine, bromine and iodine exist as covalent diatomic molecules. They become increasingly less
volatile and more deeply coloured on descending Group 17. Their volatility decreases as instantaneous dipole–
induced dipole forces between molecules increase.
All the halogen elements are oxidising agents: they are electron acceptors. Their power as oxidising agents
decreases descending Group 17.
All the halide ions can act as reducing agents: they are potential electron donors. Their power as reducing agents
increases descending Group 17.
The reactivity of the halogens decreases descending the group.
It gets easier to oxidise the hydrogen halides going down Group 17, as the strength of the hydrogen–halogen bond
decreases.
Chlorine reacts with cold hydroxide ions in a disproportionation (‘self-reduction–oxidation’) reaction.
A different disproportionation reaction takes place between chlorine and hot alkali, producing NaCl(aq), NaClO3(aq)
and water.
An important use of chlorine is in the prevention of disease by chlorination of water supplies. The reaction between
chlorine and water also involves disproportionation.

FERTILISER ISSUES
Ammonia (NH3) is a simple compound that can be made using nitrogen gas (N2). It is used to make
ammonium compounds that are very important fertilisers. Ammonium salts commonly used in
fertilisers include ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), ammonium phosphate
(NH4)3PO4 and ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4.
Nitrogen is removed from the soil when plants absorb nitrates through their roots as they grow. When
farmers harvest their crops, the nitrogen is not replaced, as the plants do not die naturally and rot
back into the soil. So farmers use fertilisers, mainly ammonium compounds, to replace this essential
nitrogen in the soil.
Nitrogen-based fertilisers must be soluble in water for plants to absorb the nitrate ions they provide.
This has created an environmental problem. The nitrates can be washed, or leached, out of the soil by
rain into groundwater. These nitrates can then end up in rivers and lakes. Once in rivers and lakes, the
nitrates promote the growth of algae (a simple water plant) on the surface, causing eutrophication
(Figure 13.1).

Figure 13.1: Fertilisers leached from farmland have caused eutrophication in this river.

When fertilisers are washed from the soil into rivers:
A bloom of algae can spread across the surface, blocking out the light for other plant life in the
water.
When the plants and algae die, bacteria in the water feed on them, decomposing the plant
material.
The bacteria multiply rapidly with so much food available, using up the dissolved oxygen in the
water.
Fish extract dissolved oxygen from water, taken in through their gills. Without this dissolved oxygen
they die, affecting the whole ecosystem.
Eutrophication isn’t the only problem with fertilisers being leached from the soil. Nitrates have also
been detected in our drinking water, especially in agricultural areas. People are worried that nitrates in
drinking water cause ‘blue baby’ syndrome (when a newborn baby’s blood is starved of oxygen), as
well as stomach cancer. But others argue that links between nitrates and diseases have not been
proven and that recommended nitrate levels are set unrealistically low.
Farmers can help limit the amount of nitrates in watercourses by adding the most economical amounts
of fertilisers at the right time of year. This will minimise the leaching of excess fertiliser from the soil
and into our rivers and lakes.

Questions for discussion
Working with another learner or group of learners:
Discuss the statement ‘Nitrogen-based fertilisers do more harm than good.’ Then feedback any
conclusions you make to the whole group.
Try to make suggestions that could help reduce any harmful effects caused by the large-scale use
of fertilisers.

13.1 Nitrogen gas
Nitrogen is in Group 15 of the Periodic Table. It is a non-metallic element that makes up about 78% of the
Earth’s atmosphere. It exists as diatomic molecules, N2.
Nitrogen gas is the main unreactive gas in air that dilutes the effects of the reactive gas, oxygen. To
understand the lack of reactivity of nitrogen gas, we have to look at the bonding within its molecules.
The electronic configuration of a nitrogen atom is 1s2 2s2 2p3. Its atoms need to gain three electrons to
achieve the noble gas configuration of neon. Nitrogen atoms do this by forming a triple covalent bond
between two N atoms (see Figure 13.2).

Figure 13.2: The triple bonding in a nitrogen molecule, N2.

The triple covalent bond is very strong. Its bond energy is almost 1000 kJ mol−1. This bond is difficult to
break and so nitrogen gas will only react under extreme conditions. For example, the nitrogen and oxygen
in the air do react together during thunderstorms (Figure 13.3).

Figure 13.3: Nitrogen oxides are formed when lightning strikes.

The complete oxidation of the nitrogen gas takes place in three steps:
Step 1: Lightning provides the high activation energy needed for the oxidation of the unreactive nitrogen
gas to form nitrogen(II) oxide:

The nitrogen(II) oxide formed is then further oxidised by oxygen in the air to give nitrogen(IV) oxide, NO2.
Step 2:
Nitrogen(IV) oxide dissolves in water droplets in the air, and reacts with more oxygen, to form a dilute
solution of nitric acid. The dilute acid falls to the Earth in rain:
Step 3:
This sequence of reactions in the atmosphere forms part of the natural nitrogen cycle. In this way, nitrogen
from unreactive, insoluble nitrogen gas can get into the soil in a soluble form that plants can absorb. The
plants can then use the nitrate ions, NO3−, from the dilute nitric acid to make proteins. These proteins are
essential for healthy growth of the plants.

13.2 Ammonia and ammonium compounds
Ammonia, NH3, is a very important compound of nitrogen. It is the only common alkaline gas. To test for
ammonia gas, use damp red litmus paper. The litmus paper will turn blue in the alkaline gas.
In industry, scientists make ammonia on a large scale using the Haber process (for details of the process
see Chapter 8).

The bonding in ammonia is shown in Figure 13.4. You learned why the presence of a lone pair of electrons
on the nitrogen atom causes ammonia molecules to have a pyramidal shape in Section 4.4.

Figure 13.4: A dot-and-cross diagram showing the covalent bonding in an ammonia molecule and its triangular pyramidal
shape. The shape is explained in Section 4.4.

You have also learned that nitrogen’s lone pair of electrons can be donated to an H+ion from an acid,
forming a co-ordinate (or dative) covalent bond (see Section 4.3 and Figure 13.5 below).

Figure 13.5: The co-ordinate (dative) covalent bond is shown by the arrow that points from the donor atom (N) to the
acceptor of the lone pair (H+ ion).

The positive charge on the ammonium ion formed is spread over the whole ammonium ion. The charge is
not concentrated on the hydrogen ion that accepted the lone pair of electrons. Chemists have found that
all the N─H bonds in the NH4+ ion are the same length. This is evidence that all four covalent bonds in the
NH4+ ion are equivalent and the positive charge is evenly spread around the ion.

Basicity of ammonia
When ammonia donates its lone pair of electrons to an H+ ion, as described above, ammonia is acting as a
base in this reaction. Remember from Section 8.6 that we can define Brønsted-Lowry bases as ‘proton (or
H+ ion) acceptors’:

Ammonia is an example of a weak base, as described in Section 8.6. In an aqueous solution of ammonia,
an equilibrium mixture is established:

NH3(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH−(aq)
The position of equilibrium lies well over to the left so there is a greater concentration of ammonia
molecules in the solution than hydroxide ions. This makes the ammonia solution only weakly alkaline,
unlike a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, which dissociates (splits up into aqueous ions) completely
in solution.
If we heat an ammonium salt with a base, the ammonium ion, NH4+, produces ammonia gas, NH3. We use
this reaction to prepare ammonia gas in the laboratory. Ammonium chloride and calcium hydroxide, both in
the solid state, are usually mixed together, then heated (see the apparatus in Figure 13.6).
2NH4Cl(s) + Ca(OH)2(s)

CaCl2(s) + 2H2O(l) + 2NH3(g)

This is an acid–base reaction, with NH4+ acting as an acid (proton, H+, donor) and OH−ions acting as a base
(proton, H+, acceptor).

Figure 13.6: Preparing ammonia gas from an ammonium salt, NH4Cl, and a base, Ca(OH)2.

We can use the acid–base reaction of an ammonium salt with a base as the basis of the test for ammonium
ions. If an unknown compound contains NH4+ ions, it will give off ammonia when heated with a base. The
ammonia given off will turn damp red litmus paper blue.

Question

Give the formula of an ammonium ion.

Discuss, with a partner, the difference in the H─N─H bond angles of an ammonium ion compared
with an ammonia molecule. Reflect on each step you need to go through to arrive at your answer.

solution with dilute nitric acid.

d

i

Write a balanced chemical equation, including state symbols, for the reaction of solid
ammonium sulfate with solid sodium hydroxide.

ii

Discuss with a partner why the reaction in part i can be classified as an acid–base reaction.

13.3 Nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere
At the start of this chapter we explained why nitrogen gas is so unreactive. However, in the extreme
conditions in a thunderstorm, lightning can trigger the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen to form
gaseous nitrogen oxides: nitrogen(II) oxide, NO, and nitrogen(IV) oxide, NO2.
A similar oxidation of nitrogen takes place at the high temperature inside a car engine. In the engine, a
mixture of air (which is mainly nitrogen, 78%, and oxygen, 21%) and fuel is compressed and ignited by a
spark. Under this high pressure and high temperature, nitrogen can form nitrogen oxides. These oxides of
nitrogen are then released into the atmosphere through the car’s exhaust fumes.
Nitrogen oxides pollute our atmosphere. They cause acid rain and photochemical smog.

Acid rain
You learned earlier that nitrogen(II) oxide, formed in lightning strikes, is oxidised to form nitrogen(IV) oxide
in air:
2NO(g) +O2(g) ⇌2NO2(g)
This is followed by further oxidation to nitric acid when nitrogen(IV) oxide dissolves and reacts in water with
oxygen:
NO2(aq) +H2O(l) +1.5 O2(g) →2HNO3(aq)
The water is often in the form of tiny droplets that make up clouds. The droplets get larger as the
temperature drops when clouds rise. When heavy enough the droplets, containing dilute nitric acid, will fall
as acid rain.
Dilute sulfuric acid is also found in acid rain. This comes from another pollutant called sulfur dioxide gas (or
sulfur(IV) oxide). Nitrogen oxides, as well as causing acid rain directly, can also act as catalysts in the
reactions that make dilute sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. NO and NO2 catalyse the oxidation of sulfur
dioxide gas, SO2, during the formation of acid rain. The gas sulfur trioxide, SO3, that is produced by this
oxidation of SO2, reacts with rainwater, forming dilute sulfuric acid:
SO3(g) + H2O(l) → H2SO4(aq)
The reactions below show the catalytic activity of the nitrogen oxides:
SO2(g) + NO2(g) → SO3(g) + NO(g)
Then NO2 is regenerated as NO reacts with oxygen in the air:
NO(g) +

O2(g) → NO2(g)

This NO2 molecule can then go on to oxidise another sulfur dioxide molecule. At the same time, the
reaction also produces an NO molecule to make another NO2 molecule. This will oxidise another sulfur
dioxide molecule, and so on. Therefore, NO2 effectively catalyses the oxidation of SO2.

Photochemical smog
The oxides of nitrogen are also dangerous in the atmosphere because they react to make other pollutants.
These other pollutants formed are called secondary pollutants. This is because they are not given off
directly from human activity: for example, they are not vehicle exhaust gases or gases from power plants.
Nitrogen oxides are examples of primary pollutants as they are given off directly into the air from the
source of pollution.
Other primary pollutants in exhaust fumes are volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These are largely
unburnt hydrocarbons from fuel, and their oxidised products. The VOCs can react in sunlight with oxides
of nitrogen to make peroxyacetyl nitrate (also called PAN). Its chemical formula can be written as
CH3CO3NO2. Sunlight provides the energy needed to start the reactions off in the atmosphere, so we call
them photochemical reactions.

Figure 13.7: Photochemical smog hangs over Los Angeles in certain weather conditions. The word ‘smog’ is derived from
the two words ‘smoke’ and ‘fog’.

IMPORTANT
PAN is one of the harmful pollutants found in photochemical smog (Figure 13.7). PAN affects the lungs
and eyes, and in high concentrations also affects plant-life.

Reducing the effects of nitrogen oxides
Nowadays, car exhaust systems are fitted with catalytic converters to help reduce the pollutants from
motor vehicles (see Section 15.2). The reaction of pollutant gases inside the converter takes place on the
surface of the hot catalyst, for example platinum. The nitrogen oxides are reduced to form harmless
nitrogen gas, which is released from the vehicle’s exhaust pipe.
2CO(g) + 2NO(g) → 2CO2(g) + N2(g)

SUMMARY
Nitrogen, N2, is a very unreactive gas because of the high bond energy of the N≡N triple bond.
Ammonia, NH3, is a common compound of nitrogen. Its molecules have a triangular pyramidal shape.
An ammonia molecule can act as a base, accepting an H+ ion to form an ammonium ion, NH4+.
Ammonia gas is given off from ammonium salts by heating them with a base.
Nitrogen oxides are formed naturally during lightning strikes, when nitrogen gas is oxidised. These gaseous nitrogen

THE MOLECULES OF LIFE
Living things are made of atoms covalently bonded to form molecules of organic compounds (Figure
14.1). Almost all of these molecules of life are based on carbon compounds.

Figure 14.1: Organic compounds form the basis of all living things. Carbon atoms tend to form the ‘backbone’ of
organic molecules: from the proteins in muscles and enzymes to the DNA (see above) that determines our
characteristics.

Life is complicated and needs a great variety of different compounds. A great variety of organic

compounds is possible because every carbon atom can bond with other carbon atoms to form chains
and rings. We often find these chains and rings bonded to atoms of other elements, such as hydrogen,
oxygen and nitrogen. This explains the millions of organic compounds that exist.
Note that not all carbon compounds are classified as organic compounds. Scientists classify the oxides
of carbon and compounds containing carbonate and hydrogencarbonate ions as inorganic compounds.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Carbohydrates (compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen) can vary in size between relatively
small molecules, such as glucose, C6H12O6, to thousands of glucose molecules bonded together in
giant polymers, such as starch and cellulose. How does the size of organic molecules change their
properties? You might consider the process of digesting a starchy food to illustrate your answer.

14.1 Representing organic molecules
Figure 14.2 shows two types of three-dimensional (3D) diagram representing a selection of organic
molecules. Chemists use various types of model for different purposes. The compounds shown are called
hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are compounds of carbon and hydrogen only.

Figure 14.2: Examples of the variety of hydrocarbons. a–c These hydrocarbons are shown as space-filling models. Such
models show the region of space occupied by the atoms and the surrounding electrons. d–g These hydrocarbons are
shown as ball-and-stick models, which enable bonds between atoms to be seen clearly.

Table 14.1: Colours used in molecular modelling in this text.

We can represent organic molecules using different types of formula.
1 The empirical formula gives us the least detail. It tells us the simplest ratio of the different types of
atoms present in the molecule. For example, an organic compound called propene has the empirical
formula CH2. This tells us that it has twice as many hydrogen atoms as carbon atoms in its molecules.
We can calculate empirical formulae from experimental data on the mass of each element in a sample
of a compound. Then we can convert the masses to the number of moles of each element present,
cancelled down to the simplest ratio.
2 The molecular formula shows us the actual numbers of each type of atom in a molecule. To find this we
need to know the relative molecular mass of the compound. The relative molecular mass of propene is
42. We know that its empirical formula is CH2. This CH2 group of atoms has a relative mass of 14, as the
relative atomic mass of C = 12 and H = 1. By dividing the relative molecular mass by the relative mass
of the empirical formula ( = 3), we see that there must be (3 × CH2) atoms in a propene molecule. So
its molecular formula is C3H6.
3 Chemists can give more detail about a molecule by giving its structural formula. This tells us about
the atoms bonded to each carbon atom in the molecule. The structural formula of propene is
CH3HC═CH2 (also written as CH3CH═CH2, but the central H atom does not form a double bond).
This structural formula tells us how many hydrogen atoms are bonded to each carbon atom. In the case
of propene, it also shows us that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are joined by a double bond.
4 Carbon–carbon double bonds are shown in a structural formula. However, all the bonds within a
molecule are shown in its displayed formula. We can think of this representation as a 2D, or flattened
out, version of the ‘ball-and-stick’ models shown in Figure 14.2. The displayed formula of propene is
shown in Figure 14.3.

Figure 14.3: The displayed formula of propene, showing all the bonds in the molecule.

A simplified version of the displayed formula is called the skeletal formula. It has all the symbols for
carbon and hydrogen atoms removed, as well as the carbon to hydrogen bonds. The carbon to carbon
bonds are left in place. Figure 14.4 shows the skeletal formula of propene.

Figure 14.4: The skeletal formula of propene.

All other atoms that are not carbon or hydrogen, and their bonds, are included in the skeletal formula of
an organic molecule. You can see the displayed and skeletal formulae of an alcohol called butan-2-ol in
Figure 14.5. Notice that the skeletal formula includes the H atom in an ─OH group.

Figure 14.5: a The displayed formula of butan-2-ol. b The skeletal formula of butan-2-ol.

You can see the ‘zig-zag’ in the carbon chain shown in a skeletal formula in the 3D representations of
hydrocarbons in Figure 14.2. You will see more detailed 3D displayed formulae later in this chapter,
when we look at optical isomers (see Section 14.6). Figure 14.6 shows the 3D displayed formula of
butan-2-ol.

Figure 14.6: The 3D displayed formula of butan-2-ol. The ‘wedge’ bond is sticking out of the plane of the paper and
the ‘dashed-line’ or ‘open wedge’ bond is sticking into the plane of the paper. This figure shows both conventions –
either representation is acceptable.

5 With complex molecules, chemists sometimes find it useful to combine structural, 3D and skeletal
formulae when representing a molecule. The molecule of cholesterol shown in Figure 14.7 is one such
example.

14.2 Homologous series of organic compounds
There are many classes of related organic compounds called homologous series, some of which are
shown in Table 14.2. Within each homologous series of compounds, all the compounds consist of molecules
with a particular atom, or grouping of atoms, called a functional group. Different classes of compounds
have different functional groups.
The functional group determines the characteristic chemical properties of the compounds that contain that
specific functional group. The functional group in an alkene is the C═C double bond. The functional group in
a carboxylic acid is the ─COOH group.
The general formulae of some homologous series of compounds are given in Table 14.3. By substituting a
number for n (or m) in the general formula, you get the molecular formula of a particular compound
containing that functional group. Note that this formula assumes there is just one functional group present
in the molecule.

14.3 Naming organic compounds
Table 14.2 shows the names of the first ten alkanes and the stems used in naming other molecules.
Chemists have a system of naming organic compounds that can be applied consistently. This means that
they can communicate with each other clearly when referring to organic compounds.

Table 14.2: The stems used in naming simple aliphatic organic compounds that contain a hydrocarbon chain.

The homologous series of hydrocarbons called alkanes provides the basis of the naming system. The stem
of each name indicates how many carbon atoms are in the longest chain in one molecule of the compound.
We indicate the position of side-chains or functional groups by numbering the carbon atoms in the longest
chain. The numbering starts at the end that produces the lowest possible numbers in the name (Figure
14.8).

Figure 14.8: This is called 2-methylpentane, not 4-methylpentane. Its structural formula is CH3CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3.

Note that the hydrocarbon side-chain is shown in brackets in its structural formula. It is named by adding ‘yl’ to the normal alkane stem, in this case a methyl group. This type of group is called an alkyl group. If
there is more than one of the same alkyl side-chain or functional group, we indicate how many by inserting
di- (for two), tri- (for three) or tetra- (for four) in front of its name. Figure 14.9 shows an example.

Figure 14.9: This is 2,2,3-trimethylpentane.

Note that adjacent numbers in a name have a comma between them, whereas numbers are separated
from words by a hyphen.
If there is more than one type of alkyl side-chain, they are listed in the name in alphabetical order (Figure
14.10).

Figure 14.10: This is 3-ethyl-2-methylpentane. (The alkyl groups appear in its name in alphabetical order).

Skeletal formula

In Table 14.3 we saw the names of compounds with common functional groups. We also use the numbering
system where necessary to indicate the position of the functional group in a molecule. For some functional
groups, no number is needed if the group can only be positioned at the end of a chain. Examples of this
include carboxylic acids such as butanoic acid, C3H7COOH, and aldehydes, such as pentanal, C4H9CHO.
As well as alkyl groups, you will also have to recognise aryl groups. Aryl compounds contain at least one
benzene ring. A benzene molecule has six carbon atoms arranged in a hexagon, with each carbon atom
bonded to one hydrogen atom. You will look at benzene and related compounds in more detail in Chapter
25.
Figure 14.11 shows the displayed and skeletal formulae of benzene.

Figure 14.11: Ways of representing benzene.

If only one alkyl group is bonded to a benzene ring, we do not have to include a number in the name. This
is because all six carbon atoms in the ring are equivalent. However, at A Level, you will learn that with two
or more alkyl groups we need to indicate their positions, as shown in Figure 14.12. (You do not need to
recall this numbering for AS Level.)

14.4 Bonding in organic molecules
We can explain the ability of a carbon atom to bond to other carbon atoms, and the shapes of the
molecules formed, by looking closely at the bonding involved.

Sigma (σ) bonds
Each carbon atom has six electrons, with an electronic configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p2. This means that carbon
has four electrons in its outermost shell. By forming single covalent bonds with four other atoms, a
carbon atom can gain the electronic configuration of the noble gas neon (see Section 4.2). These single
covalent bonds are known as sigma (σ) bonds.
The pair of electrons in a σ bond is found in a region of space (described as a lobe) between the nuclei of
the two atoms sharing the electrons. The electrostatic attraction, between the negatively charged electrons
and the two positively charged nuclei, bonds the atoms to each other (see Section 4.3).
In many organic compounds each carbon atom forms four σ bonds. The four bonding pairs of electrons
(which are all areas of negative charge) around each carbon atom repel each other. They position
themselves in a tetrahedral arrangement so that the bonding pairs are as far apart from each other as
possible. The tetrahedral bond angle is 109.5° (see Section 4.4). Figure 14.13 shows the 3D formula of an
ethane molecule. This gives an impression of the shape of an ethane molecule.

Figure 14.13: The bond angles are all close to 109.5° in an ethane molecule. The two carbon atoms, each forming four
sigma bonds, are said to be sp3 hybridised (see Section 4.5).

Pi (π) bonds
Carbon can also form double and triple bonds between its atoms in organic molecules, as well as forming
single bonds. A C═C double bond, as found in alkenes such as ethene, is made up of a σ bond and a pi (π)
bond. The carbon atoms involved in the double bond will each form three σ bonds. This is an example of
sp2 hybridisation (see Section 4.5). This leaves each carbon atom with one spare outer electron in a 2p
orbital. When these two p orbitals overlap they form a π bond. Figure 14.14 shows how the π bond is
formed in ethene.

Figure 14.14: The overlap of two p orbitals results in a π bond. Ethene is described as a planar molecule. All the carbon
and hydrogen atoms in the ethene molecule lie in the same plane. The two carbon atoms are said to be sp2 hybridised
(see Section 4.5).

The two lobes that make up the π bond lie above and below the plane of the atoms in an ethene molecule.
This maximises overlap of the p orbitals. The carbon atoms involved in the double bond are each
surrounded by three pairs of electrons in the σ bonds. These are all in the plane of the molecule and repel
each other to give bond angles of about 120°.
You can read about the special case of π bonding in a benzene molecule in Section 25.1.
Carbon atoms can also form triple covalent bonds, C≡C. These are found in the homologous series of
alkynes. The simplest example of an alkyne is ethyne, HC≡CH.
When forming a triple bond, the carbon atoms’ p orbitals are sp hybridised (see Section 4.5). This leaves
two electrons in different p atomic orbitals on each of the bonding carbon atoms. The p orbitals overlap,
forming two π bonds, each containing two electrons.
The two lobes of one π bond lie above and below the plane of the atoms in the ethyne molecule (as in
ethene). The two lobes of the other π bond lie in front of and behind the plane of the atoms in the ethyne
molecule.
This maximises overlap of the p orbitals, which in effect form a cylinder of electron density around the two
carbon atoms. The ethyne molecule is linear in shape, with all its atoms arranged in a straight line (Figure
14.15).

Figure 14.15: The overlap of four p orbitals resulting in two π bonds in ethyne. Ethyne is described as a linear molecule.
The two carbon atoms and both hydrogen atoms in the ethyne molecule lie in a straight line. The two carbon atoms are
said to be sp hybridised.

reasoning when your answers are not the same and arrive at an agreed answer. Show these agreed
answers to your teacher if you are still in doubt.

14.5 Structural isomerism
We have seen how a compound’s molecular formula tells us the number and type of each atom in one
molecule of the compound. For example, a propene molecule, C3H6 (Figure 14.16), contains three carbon
atoms and six hydrogen atoms:

Figure 14.16: The displayed formula of propene, C3H6.

However, for a given molecular formula there may be different ways of arranging these atoms. This means
different molecules can be formed, with different structures, resulting in different compounds. Such
compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural formulae are called structural
isomers. For example, the molecular formula propene, C3H6, could also describe cyclopropane (Figure
14.17).

Figure 14.17: The displayed formula of another possible structure, called a structural isomer, of molecules with the
formula C3H6. Cyclopropane is an example of a cyclic alkane. Its structural formula is (CH2)3.

There are three types of structural isomerism:
1 position isomerism
2 functional group isomerism
3 chain isomerism.

Position isomerism
In position isomerism, it is the location of the functional group that varies in each isomer. An example is
provided by the compound with the molecular formula C3H6Br2. Its four possible isomers are shown in
Figure 14.18.

Figure 14.18: An example of position isomerism.

You need to take care when drawing the structural or displayed formula of different isomers not to repeat
the same structure. Remember that there is free rotation about C─C single bonds. The three molecules
shown in Figure 14.19 are all 1,2-dibromopropane; they are not three different isomers of C3H6Br2.

Figure 14.19: These are different ways of representing the same molecule because of free rotation about C─C single
bonds.

Functional group isomerism
In functional group isomerism, there are different functional groups present. For example, given the
molecular formula C3H8O we can draw both an alcohol and an ether (Figure 14.20).
These two isomers have different functional groups and so have very different chemical properties.

Figure 14.20: An example of functional group isomerism.

Chain isomerism
Chain isomers differ in the structure of their carbon ‘skeleton’. For example, butane and methylpropane are
chain isomers, both with the molecular formula of C4H10 (Figure 14.21).

Figure 14.21: An example of chain isomerism.

Check all your answers with a small group of other learners. Discuss any differences between your
answers and agree on the best answer for each question.

14.6 Stereoisomerism
Stereoisomers are compounds whose molecules have the same atoms bonded to each other, but with
different arrangements of the atoms in space.
There are two types of stereoisomerism:
1 geometrical (cis/trans) isomerism
2 optical isomerism.

Geometrical (cis/trans) isomerism
Unlike a C─C single bond, there is no free rotation about a C═C double bond. This can result in a different
type of isomerism in unsaturated organic compounds. Figure 14.22 gives an example.

Figure 14.22: An example of geometrical (cis/trans) isomerism.

In cis-1,2-dibromoethene, both the Br atoms remain fixed on the same side of the C═C double bond as
there is no free rotation about this bond because of the presence of a π (pi) bond. However, in trans-1,2dibromoethene, the Br atoms are positioned across the C═C double bond. (Remember that the prefix
‘trans-’ means across.)
These two stereoisomers have different arrangements of the atoms in space, so they are different
compounds with different physical properties. Stereoisomers can also have some different chemical
properties. For example, they may react at different rates for the same reaction. Whenever we have
unsaturated compounds with the structures shown in Figure 14.23, we can have this geometrical (cis/trans)
type of isomerism.

Figure 14.23: These three arrangements can result in geometrical (cis/trans) isomerism because there is restricted
rotation about the C═C double bond.

There is also geometrical (cis/trans) isomerism possible in substituted cyclic compounds. This is because of
the limited rotation about C─C single bonds that make up the rings. We usually show the cis- and transisomers using a combination of skeletal and 3D formulae. For example, cis-3-methylcyclopentanol and
trans-3-methylcyclopentanol:

We can also show the two cis/trans isomers more clearly from a side view:

Another example is a substituted compound of cyclobutane, with two groups substituted into its fourmembered ring. The two geometrical isomers below are called cis- and trans-cyclobutane-1,3-dicarboxylic
acid:

In the cis-isomer, the two carboxylic acid groups are either both pointing above (as shown) or both below
the ring of four carbon atoms. In the trans-isomer, one carboxylic acid group points above the ring and one
below.

Optical isomerism
If a molecule contains a carbon atom that is bonded to four different atoms or groups of atoms, it can form
two optical isomers. We can describe this carbon atom as an ‘asymmetric’ carbon atom because there is no
plane of symmetry in its molecule. The two different optical isomers, called enantiomers, are mirror
images of each other, and they cannot be superimposed (Figure 14.24). The carbon atom with the four
different groups attached to it is called the chiral centre of the molecule.

Figure 14.24: This pair of molecules are optical isomers, referred to as enantiomers. Trying to superimpose the two
isomers is like trying to superimpose your left hand on top of your right hand, with them both facing downwards: it can’t
be done.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 14.1

Modelling optical isomers
Using a molecular modelling kit, take a black carbon atom and attach four different coloured atoms to
it. Then make another model molecule that is its mirror image using the same colours. Now try
superimposing the two models so all the atoms match up. Can it be done?
Optical isomers differ in their effect on polarised light. Normal light is unpolarised. It can be thought of as
fluctuating electric and magnetic fields, vibrating at right angles to each other in every possible direction.
Passing this unpolarised light through a polariser results in polarised light, which vibrates in only one plane.
A pair of optical isomers will rotate the plane of polarised light by equal amounts but in opposite directions.
One will rotate the plane of polarised light clockwise and the other anticlockwise.
Organic molecules can contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom, i.e. more than one chiral centre. If
there are two asymmetric carbon atoms, then each of its chiral centres will rotate the plane of polarised
light. In this case, there will be four possible optical isomers.
As well as straight and branched chain molecules, substituted cyclic molecules can also have chiral centres
in their ring structures. To decide where the chiral centres are, we still have to find any carbon atoms that
are bonded to four different atoms or groups of atoms.
Look at this example of a substituted cyclohexane molecule:

In cyclohexane all the carbon atoms are bonded to two hydrogen atoms so there is no chiral centre. But
when you start substituting other groups or atoms to replace hydrogen atoms, there is a possibility of
asymmetric carbon atoms.
In the cyclic molecule shown we have a hydroxyl (─OH) group and an amine (─NH2) group introduced into
the ring. Let’s consider the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl (─OH) group first. This carbon atom is also
bonded to a hydrogen atom (not shown in the skeletal formula). The other two groups bonded to it, making
up its four single bonds, are not the same. Imagine travelling around the ring in a clockwise direction from
this carbon atom, you come to four carbon atoms, each bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Then you come to
the carbon bonded to the ─NH2 group and one hydrogen atom, before arriving back where we started. We
can think of this group as ─(CH2)4CHNH2. After that, travel around the ring in the opposite direction, an
anti-clockwise direction, from same original carbon. This fourth bond from the carbon atom will be attached
to a ─CHNH2(CH2)4 group, so the original carbon atom has four different groups or atoms bonded to it:
an H atom
the ─OH group
the ─(CH2)4CHNH2 group
the ─CHNH2(CH2)4 group.
Now you follow the same process starting from the carbon atom bonded to the ─NH2 group. You will find
that this is also an asymmetric carbon atom. Therefore this cyclic molecule has two chiral centres.
Symmetrical substituted cyclic molecules will not have a chiral centre. Starting from the carbon atom(s)
bonded to the group(s) substituted into the ring, you will find two identical groups ‘going around’ the ring
in both the clockwise and the anticlockwise direction. Therefore, no carbon atom has four different groups
attached to it.

14.7 Types of organic reaction and reaction
mechanisms
Chemists find it useful to explain organic reactions by summarising the overall reaction in a series of steps
called a reaction mechanism. Like all chemical reactions, organic reactions involve the breaking and
making of chemical bonds. There are two ways in which covalent bonds can break:
homolytic fission
heterolytic fission.

Homolytic fission
In this type of bond breaking, both the atoms at each end of the bond leave with one electron from the pair
that formed the covalent bond. This is shown in Figure 14.25, using the simple example of a hydrogen
chloride molecule.

Figure 14.25: Homolytic fission of a covalent bond.

The species produced when a bond breaks homolytically are called free radicals. We can show the
formation of free radicals by using an equation:
HCl → H· + Cl·
H· and Cl· are free radicals. All free radicals have an unpaired electron (represented by the dot) and are
very reactive.
You can read more about a free-radical reaction in Section 15.2.
This type of reaction involves the formation of the free radicals in an initiation step. This requires an input
of energy to break a covalent bond, resulting in two free radicals.
The radicals formed can then attack reactant molecules, generating more free radicals. These reactions are
called propagation steps. You can think of these as a chain reaction which only stops when free radicals
react with each other.
Two free radicals reacting together will form a molecule, with no free radicals generated. We call this a
termination step.
The three steps in a free-radical reaction are:
initiation step: the formation of free radicals to start a reaction off
propagation steps: steps in a mechanism that regenerate more free radicals
termination step: the final step in a mechanism, when two free radicals meet and form a product
molecule.

Heterolytic fission
The second type of bond breaking involves the ‘uneven’ breaking of a covalent bond. In heterolytic fission,
the more electronegative atom takes both electrons in the covalent bond. Again, we can use hydrogen
chloride to illustrate this (Figure 14.26).

Figure 14.26: Heterolytic fission of a covalent bond.

We can show this type of bond breaking in an equation. A small curly arrow shows the movement of a pair
of electrons:

The heterolytic fission of a bond can involve a C─X bond, where X is an atom more electronegative than
carbon.
For example:

In this case, as the bond breaks, the Br atom takes both shared electrons, forming a bromide anion (a
negatively charged ion). This leaves the methyl group one electron short, resulting in the formation of a
positively charged ion. This type of alkyl ion is called a carbocation. These positively charged
carbocations often appear in reaction mechanisms (see Section 16.3).
There are three types of carbocations that you need to consider: primary, secondary and tertiary
carbocations (Figure 14.27).

Figure 14.27: Carbocations and their stability relative to each other.

Note that the carbon atom with the positive charge only has three covalent bonds, not the usual four,
making it electron deficient. Any alkyl groups (e.g. ─CH3, ─C2H5, ─C3H7) attached to the positively charged
carbon atom tend to be ‘electron donating’. We say the alkyl groups have a positive inductive effect. The
arrowheads on the bonds in Figure 14.27 are used to show the inductive effect of atoms or groups of
atoms.
The alkyl groups ‘push’ electrons away from themselves, and reduce the charge density of the positive
charge on the carbocation. This has the effect of spreading out the charge around the carbocation, making
it energetically more stable. This means that a tertiary carbocation, with its three ‘electron-donating’ alkyl
groups is the most energetically stable of the three types of carbocation.

IMPORTANT
The more alkyl groups adjacent to the positively charged carbon atom, the more stable the
carbocation.
As a result of this, tertiary carbocations are more likely to form in reaction mechanisms than secondary
carbocations, and primary carbocations are least favoured. This has effects on the products of some
organic reactions, such as addition reactions to alkenes (see Section 15.3).
Carbocations are an example of a species called an electrophile.
When an electrophile accepts a pair of electrons, this results in the formation of a new covalent bond (see
Section 15.3).
You will also meet nucleophiles when studying organic reactions and their mechanisms. These are
electron-rich species, i.e. they carry a negative (−), or partial negative (δ−), charge.
When a nucleophile donates a pair of electrons, this leads to the formation of a new covalent bond with the
electron-deficient atom under attack (see Section 18.4).

14.8 Types of organic reaction
Addition reactions involve the formation of a single product from two or more reactant molecules. An
example is the addition reaction between an alkene and bromine (see Section 15.3):
C2H4 + Br2 → C2H4Br2
Elimination reactions result in the removal of a small molecule from a larger reactant molecule. An
example is the dehydration of an alcohol by concentrated sulfuric acid (see Section 17.3):
C2H5OH

C 2H 4 + H 2O

Condensation reactions involve a first step where addition takes place. This is followed by a second step
where elimination occurs to form the final product. You will meet condensation reactions in Chapter 18
when you study carbonyl compounds.
Substitution reactions involve the replacement of one atom, or a group of atoms, by another. For
example, the free-radical substitution of alkanes by chlorine in sunlight (see Section 15.2):
CH4 + Cl2

CH3Cl + HCl

Here, an H atom in CH4 has been replaced by a Cl atom.
Hydrolysis is the breakdown of a molecule by water. We can speed up this type of reaction by adding acid
or alkali. For example, the hydrolysis of a halogenoalkane by water to give an alcohol (see Section 16.2):
C2H5Br + H2O → C2H5OH + HBr
Hydrolysis with alkali is faster, and gives slightly different products:
C2H5Br + NaOH → C2H5OH + NaBr
Oxidation is defined as the loss of electrons from a species. However, in organic reactions it is often simpler
to think of oxidation reactions in terms of the number of oxygen and / or hydrogen atoms before and
after a reaction.
An example is the partial oxidation of ethanol to ethanal using acidified potassium dichromate(VI) solution
(see Section 17.3):
C2H5OH + [O] → CH3CHO + H2O
before the reaction ethanol contains one O atom and six H atoms
after the reaction ethanal contains one O atom and four H atoms.
In effect, the ethanol loses two H atoms, so we can say that ethanol has been oxidised.
Notice that we use [O] to simplify the chemical equation describing oxidation reactions. This is commonly
used, but the equation must still be balanced: just like a normal equation. For example, in the complete
oxidation of ethanol to ethanoic acid, using the reagents above but under harsher conditions (see Section
17.3):
C2H5OH + 2[O] → CH3COOH + H2O
[O] represents an oxygen atom from the oxidising agent. The 2 in front of the [O] is needed to balance the
equation for oxygen atoms.
For example, in the reduction of a ketone, using sodium tetrahydridoborate, NaBH4 (see Section 18.3):
CH3COCH3 + 2[H] → CH3CH(OH)CH3
Notice that we use [H] to simplify the chemical equation describing reduction reactions. [H] represents a
hydrogen atom from the reducing agent. The 2 in front of the [H] is necessary to balance the equation for
hydrogen atoms.

REFLECTION

The ideas introduced in this chapter will all be revisited in later organic chemistry chapters. It will
be useful for you to create a mind map now of the various ideas introduced. Put ‘Organic
chemistry’ at the centre and label the links branching out to the new concepts. These could
include ‘functional groups’, ‘bonding’, ‘isomers’, ‘mechanisms’, ‘types of reaction’.
Your mind map will be useful to refer back to when studying the other organic chapters and when
revising for exams.

Swap your mind map with another learner and discuss similarities and differences. Discuss the
strengths and weaknesses in both mind maps.
Then explain to each other the process you both applied when constructing your mind map.

SUMMARY
We can represent an organic molecule, with increasing detail, by using its:
empirical formula
molecular formula
structural formula
displayed formula
3D displayed formula.
Functional groups give organic compounds their characteristic reactions.
Important functional groups include alkenes, alcohols, halogenoalkanes, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids,
esters, amines and nitriles.
The shapes of organic molecules can be explained by the σ and π bonds between carbon atoms, and the
hybridisation of their atomic orbitals.
There are two types of isomer: structural isomers and stereoisomers.
Structural isomers have the same molecular formula but different structural formulae. We can group these into
position, functional group or chain isomers.
Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangement of their atoms in space.
Cis/trans isomers arise because of the restricted rotation around a C═C double bond.
Optical isomers contain a chiral centre (a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups of atoms),
resulting in mirror images of the molecule that cannot be superimposed.

HYDROCARBONS IN USE
Crude oil (Figure 15.1) is our main source of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are compounds containing
carbon and hydrogen only. They provide us with fuels such as petrol, diesel and kerosene.
Hydrocarbons are also the starting compounds used to make many new compounds, such as most of
the plastics we use in everyday life.
Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. It contains alkanes, cycloalkanes and arenes
(compounds containing benzene rings – see Chapter 25).
Cycloalkanes are saturated hydrocarbons in which there is a ‘ring’ consisting of three or more carbon
atoms. Imagine the two carbon atoms at each end of a straight-chain alkane bonding to each other.
These two carbon atoms could then only bond to two hydrogen atoms each, not three as in the
straight-chain alkane. Cyclohexane, C6H12, is an example (Figure 15.2). Note that a cycloalkane does
not follow the general alkane formula, CnH2n+2.

Figure 15.1: Crude oil is extracted from porous seams of rock found beneath an impervious layer of rock within the
Earth’s crust.

Figure 15.2: Hexane (C6H14) and cyclohexane (C6H12).

The crude oil is brought to the surface at oil wells and transported to an oil refinery. The actual
composition of crude oil varies in different oilfields around the world.
At the refinery, the crude oil is processed into useful fuels. The first step is fractional distillation of the
oil. This separates the wide range of different hydrocarbons into fractions. The hydrocarbons in each
fraction will have similar boiling points. This is carried out in tall fractionating columns.
The oil-based compounds that are in high demand are the gasoline fraction (providing petrol) and the
naphtha fraction (providing the starting compounds for making many other chemicals in industry).

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
As you know, the supplies of crude oil are a finite resource and they are rapidly running out. One way
to conserve the oil we have left is to switch from petrol and diesel cars to electric cars. Discuss the
difficulties in making the switch to electric vehicles, as well as the benefits it will bring. Then feedback
your main points to the rest of your group.

15.1 The homologous group of alkanes
The majority of compounds found in the mixture of hydrocarbons we call crude oil are alkanes. We met the
first ten members of this homologous series in Table 14.2. The general formula for the alkanes is CnH2n+2.
For example, the molecular formula of pentane, in which n = 5, is C5H12 (Figure 15.3).

Figure 15.3: Three different ways of representing pentane molecules.

Note that all the carbon–carbon bonds are single covalent bonds. The carbon atoms all display sp3
hybridisation (see Section 4.5). This means that alkanes have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms in
their molecules, and are known as saturated hydrocarbons (Figure 15.4).

Figure 15.4: The 3D displayed formula shows the tetrahedral arrangement of atoms around each carbon atom
(approximate bond angles of 109.5º).

What is the general formula of cycloalkanes?

d

Give two differences between a molecule of cyclopentane and a molecule of pentane.

15.2 Reactions of alkanes
The alkanes are generally unreactive compounds. We can explain this by the very small difference in
electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen. Their atoms share the pair of electrons in the single
covalent bonds almost equally. Therefore, alkane molecules are non-polar, so they are not attacked by
nucleophiles or electrophiles (Figure 15.5). They have no partial positive charges (δ+) on any of their
carbon atoms to attract nucleophiles, neither do they have areas of high electron density to attract
electrophiles (see Section 14.7).
However, the alkanes do react with oxygen in combustion reactions and also undergo substitution by
halogens in sunlight. These reactions are covered in the following sections.

Figure 15.5: Non-polar alkanes do not react with polar compounds such as water. The hexane is dyed with iodine to make
it coloured, so it is more clearly visible. The hexane and water in the test-tube are immiscible: they do not mix and they do
not react with each other.

Combustion of alkanes
Alkanes are often used as fuels (Figure 15.6). We burn them for many reasons:
to generate electricity in power stations,
to heat our homes and cook our food
to provide energy needed in industrial processes
to provide fuel for ships, aeroplanes, trains, lorries, buses, cars and motorbikes.

Figure 15.6: Alkanes are useful fuels.

If we burn an alkane in plenty of oxygen, the alkane will undergo complete combustion. All the carbon will
be oxidised fully to form carbon dioxide, and all the hydrogen will be oxidised to form water:
alkane + oxygen

carbon dioxide + water

For example, octane is one of the alkanes in petrol that is burned inside the internal combustion engine in
motor vehicles. Some of the octane will undergo complete combustion in a car engine:
2C8H18 + 25O2 → 16CO2 + 18H2O
octane + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water
The equation can also be written as:
C8H18 + 12

O2 → 8CO2 + 9H2O

Pollution from burning hydrocarbon fuels
When the petrol or diesel is mixed with air inside a car engine, there is only a limited supply of oxygen.
Under these conditions, not all the carbon in the hydrocarbon fuel is fully oxidised to carbon dioxide. Some
of the carbon is only partially oxidised to form carbon monoxide (CO) gas. This is called incomplete
combustion.
For example:
2C8H18 + 17O2
octane + oxygen

16CO + 18H2O
carbon monoxide + water

or
C8H18 + 8

O2 → 8CO + 9H2O

Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that bonds with the haemoglobin in your blood. The haemoglobin
molecules can then no longer bond to oxygen and so cannot transport oxygen around your body. Victims of
carbon monoxide poisoning will feel dizzy, then lose consciousness. If not removed from the toxic gas, the
victim will die.
Carbon monoxide is odourless, so this adds to the danger. This is why faulty gas heaters in which

incomplete combustion occurs can kill unsuspecting people in rooms with poor ventilation.
As well as releasing carbon monoxide, road traffic also releases acidic nitrogen oxides, mainly NO and NO2.
These contribute to the problem of acid rain (see Section 13.3). Acid rain can kill trees and aquatic animals
in lakes (Figure 15.7). Acid rain also erodes limestone buildings and statues, as well as corroding metals,
such as iron.

Figure 15.7: These trees have been badly damaged by acid rain.

In normal combustion, nitrogen gas in the air is not oxidised. However, in the very high temperatures in car
engines, oxidation of nitrogen does take place. A variety of nitrogen oxides can be formed and released in
the car’s exhaust fumes (Figure 15.8). For example:
N2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g)
2NO(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)

Figure 15.8: The vast numbers of cars on the roads pollute our atmosphere. Nitrogen oxides from traffic contribute to
photochemical smog, as well as acid rain.

As well as toxic carbon monoxide and acidic nitrogen oxides, cars also release unburnt hydrocarbons, often
referred to as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), into the air. Some of these are carcinogens (they cause
cancers) and can form PAN, a contributor to photochemical smog (see Section 13.3).

Reducing traffic emissions
Motor vehicles can now be fitted with catalytic converters in their exhaust systems (Figure 15.9). Once
warmed up, a catalytic converter can cause the following reactions to take place:
the oxidation of carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide
the reduction of nitrogen oxides to form harmless nitrogen gas
the oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons to form carbon dioxide and water.
Unfortunately, catalytic converters can do nothing to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse
gas) given off in the exhaust gases of cars and trucks.

Figure 15.9: Catalytic converters reduce the pollutants from car exhausts. Precious metals, such as platinum, are coated
on a honeycomb structure to provide a large surface area on which the reactions can occur.

The following equation describes the reaction between carbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide. It takes
place on the surface of the precious metal catalyst in a catalytic converter:
2CO + 2NO → 2CO2 + N2
Some of the carbon monoxide gas can also be oxidised inside the hot catalytic converter:
2CO + O2 → 2CO2
Note that more carbon dioxide is released in the process of removing carbon monoxide. Carbon dioxide is
not a toxic gas, but it is still considered a pollutant because of its contribution to enhanced global warming,
resulting in climate change.

Now swap your answers with another learner and compare your responses. Discuss any differences,
and arrive at an agreed set of answers before looking up the correct answers online.

Substitution reactions of alkanes
The alkanes will undergo substitution reactions with halogens in sunlight.
Consider the reaction between ethane and chlorine in sunlight:

In this reaction, a hydrogen atom in the ethane molecule gets replaced by a chlorine atom. However, this
type of reaction does not take place in darkness (Figure 15.10). So what role does the sunlight play in the
mechanism of this substitution reaction?

Initiation step
The first step in the mechanism is the breaking of the Cl─Cl bond by energy from ultraviolet light in
sunlight. This is called the initiation step in the mechanism:

Figure 15.10: A substitution reaction takes place between alkanes and bromine in sunlight, but there is no reaction in
darkness.

As the Cl─Cl bond breaks, each chlorine atom takes one electron from the pair of electrons in the Cl─Cl
bond. This is an example of homolytic fission of a covalent bond (see Section 14.7). Two Cl atoms are
formed. These Cl atoms, each with an unpaired electron, are called free radicals.

Propagation steps
Free radicals are very reactive. They will attack the normally unreactive alkanes. A chlorine free radical will

attack the ethane molecule:
CH3CH3 + Cl· → ·CH2CH3 + HCl
In this propagation step, a C─H bond in CH3CH3 breaks homolytically. An ethyl free radical, ·CH2CH3, is
produced. This can then attack a chlorine molecule, forming chloroethane and regenerating a chlorine free
radical:
·CH2CH3 + Cl2 → CH3CH2Cl + Cl·
Then the first propagation step can be repeated as the chlorine free radical can attack another ethane
molecule. This forms the ethyl free radical, which regenerates another chlorine free radical, and so on.
The word ‘propagation’ usually refers to growing new plants. In this mechanism the substitution reaction
progresses (grows) in a type of chain reaction.
This reaction is not really suitable for preparing specific halogenoalkanes, because we get a mixture of
substitution products. In the reaction between ethane and chlorine, the products can include many
different chloroalkanes. These can include 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane,
1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and so on, as well as chloroethane. If there is enough
chlorine present, we eventually get hexachloroethane (C2Cl6), This variety of chloroalkane products results
from propagation steps in which a chlorine free radical attacks a chloroalkane already formed.
For example:
CH3CH2Cl + Cl· → ·CH2CH2Cl + HCl
This can then be followed by:

The more chlorine gas in the reaction mixture to start with, the greater the proportions of chlorine atoms in
the chloroalkane molecules formed.

Termination steps
Whenever two free radicals meet they will react with each other. A single molecule is the only product. As
no free radicals are made that can carry on the reaction sequence, the chain reaction stops. Examples of
termination steps include:

IMPORTANT
In the initiation step, we start with a molecule and get two free radicals formed.
In each propagation step, we start with a molecule and a free radical and get a different molecule
and a different free radical formed.
In the termination steps, we start with two free radicals and end up with a molecule and no free
radicals.

Overall, the reaction between alkanes and halogens, involving initiation, propagation and termination
steps, is called free-radical substitution.

15.3 The alkenes
We have looked at the nature of the double bond found in the hydrocarbons called alkenes in Section 14.4.
Alkenes with one double bond per molecule have the general formula CnH2n. One example is ethene, C2H4.
Whereas alkanes, which contain only single bonds, are described as saturated hydrocarbons, we describe
alkenes as unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Oil refineries provide useful alkenes for the chemical industry. In the introduction to this chapter, we saw
how crude oil is separated into fractions at a refinery. Oil companies find that the demand for each fraction
differs. The lighter fractions, such as the gasoline fraction, are in high demand. So, chemical engineers
convert some of the excess heavier fractions into lighter hydrocarbons. The large, less useful hydrocarbon
molecules are broken down into smaller, more useful molecules. The process is called cracking.
The larger hydrocarbon molecules are fed into a steel chamber that contains no oxygen, so combustion
does not take place. The larger hydrocarbon molecules are heated to a high temperature and are passed
over an aluminium oxide, Al2O3, catalyst (Figure 15.11).

Figure 15.11: a A catalytic cracker occupies the bulk of the central part of this view of an oil refinery. b A computer
graphic showing a catalyst used to crack hydrocarbons.

When large alkane molecules are cracked, they form smaller alkane molecules and alkene molecules. One
possible example of a cracking reaction is:
CH3(CH2)8CH3
C10H22

CH3(CH2)4CH3 + CH2═CHCH2CH3

C6H14 + C4H8

The low-molecular mass alkanes formed (C6H14 in this example) make very useful fuels and are in high
demand. However, the alkenes produced (C4H8 in this example) are also very useful. They are more
reactive than the alkanes because of their double bonds. This makes them useful for the chemical industry
as the starting compounds (feedstock) for making many new products. These include most plastics (see
Section 15.5).
As well as the cracking of alkanes, alkenes can also be made by:
elimination of a hydrogen halide (e.g. HCl) from a halogenoalkane by heating with ethanolic sodium
hydroxide (see Section 16.4)
dehydration of an alcohol by using a heated catalyst (e.g. aluminium oxide, Al2O3) or a concentrated
acid (see Section 17.3).
Dehydration is the elimination of a water molecule from a reactant molecule.

Question
4

a

Name the first member of the homologous series of alkenes.

b

Give the molecular formula of the alkene containing 18 carbon atoms and one C═C bond.

c

Look at the equation for cracking given in the text. Write a word equation for this reaction.

d

Write a balanced equation to show the cracking of nonane into heptane and ethene.

e

Discuss and suggest why ‘Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes’. Think about whether
electrophiles or nucleophiles would attack alkenes and explain your choice.

Addition reactions of the alkenes
Most reactions of the alkenes are examples of addition reactions. In these reactions one of the two bonds in
the carbon–carbon (C═C) double bond is broken and a new single bond is formed from each of the two
carbon atoms.
The general addition reactions are shown in Figure 15.12.

Figure 15.12: General equations for addition reactions of the alkenes: a with a hydrogen halide, such as hydrogen
bromide, and b with a halogen, such as chlorine.

Addition of hydrogen, H2(g)
When hydrogen gas and an alkene are heated and passed over a finely divided platinum / nickel catalyst,
the addition reaction produces an alkane:
═

The addition reaction of alkenes with hydrogen is called hydrogenation, and is used in the manufacture of
margarine (Figure 15.13).

Figure 15.13: Unsaturated oils, such as sunflower oil, contain hydrocarbon chains with several carbon–carbon double
bonds. These oils become partially saturated by reacting them with hydrogen, straightening their hydrocarbon chains. This
raises the melting points of the oils, changing them from liquids to soft solids that can be spread easily.

Addition of hydrogen halides, HX(aq)

When an alkene is bubbled through a concentrated solution of a hydrogen halide (either HF, HCl, HBr or HI)
at room temperature, the product is a halogenoalkane. For example:
═

With longer, asymmetric alkenes there are always two possible products that could be formed.
For example, with propene:
═

and
═

IMPORTANT
Where two addition products are possible, the major product is the one that has the halogen atom
bonded to the C═C carbon atom with the highest number of alkyl groups bonded to it.
In the two reactions of propene with HBr shown, the Br bonds to the central C atom to form the major
product. The central C atom has two alkyl (methyl) groups bonded to it compared with the single alkyl
(ethyl) group on the end C atom. Therefore, CH3CHBrCH3 is the major product.
We can explain why this happens by thinking back to the stability of the carbocations discussed in Section
14.7. Remember that each alkyl group tends to donate electrons along its bond to the positively charged
carbon atom in the carbocation. The CH3CHBrCH3 is formed from a secondary carbocation intermediate,
CH3C+HCH3. In Section 14.7 we saw that a secondary carbocation is more stable than a primary
carbocation, in this case CH3CH2C+H2. This is because the positive charge becomes less concentrated by
the inductive effect of two alkyl groups rather than just one alkyl group. Therefore, the secondary
carbocation intermediate is more readily formed in the course of the addition reaction.
The mechanism of electrophilic addition that follows shows how:
a carbocation forms
which is then attacked by a negative ion
to give the final product of the addition reaction.

Figure 15.14: The mechanism for the electrophilic addition of HBr to propene.

Addition of steam, H2O(g)
Scientists in industry use the addition of steam to alkenes to make alcohols. They react steam and the
gaseous alkene at a high temperature and pressure, in the presence of concentrated phosphoric acid,
H3PO4, as the catalyst. When the alkene is ethene, the product is ethanol (Figure 15.15). However, the
ethanol found in alcoholic drinks is always produced by the fermentation of glucose.

Figure 15.15: The addition reaction between ethene and steam.

Addition of halogens, X2(aq)
If we bubble an alkene through a solution of chlorine or bromine at room temperature, we again get an
addition reaction. The colour of the halogen molecules in solution is removed in the course of the reaction
(Figures 15.16 and 15.17).

Figure 15.16: The reaction between ethene and bromine.

The reactant Cl2(aq) is a very pale green solution, called chlorine water. Bromine water, Br2(aq), is orange
or yellow, depending on the concentration of bromine water.
Bromine water is used to test for the presence of the C═C bond in compounds. The compound to be tested
is shaken with bromine water. If it is unsaturated, the bromine water will be decolorised.

Figure 15.17: The addition reaction used to test for an unsaturated compound.

The mechanism of electrophilic addition to alkenes
In Section 14.4 we saw how the double bond in ethene is formed from a σ (sigma) bond and a π (pi) bond.
There are four electrons in total in this double bond. So although ethene is a non-polar molecule, there is
an area of high electron density around the C═C bond. This makes the alkenes open to attack by
electrophiles (see Section 14.7).
Remember that an electrophile is an acceptor of a pair of electrons. HBr is a polar molecule because of the
difference in electronegativity between the H atom and the Br atom. In a molecule of HBr, the H atom
carries a partial positive charge and the Br atom carries a partial negative charge.
In the mechanism of addition, the H atom acts as the electrophile, accepting a pair of electrons from the
C═C bond in the alkene. Look back to Figure 15.14.
But how can a non-polar molecule such as Br2 act as an electrophile? As the bromine molecule and ethene
molecules approach each other, the area of high electron density around the C═C bond repels the pair of
electrons in the Br─Br bond away from the nearer Br atom. This makes the nearer Br atom slightly positive
and the further Br atom slightly negative. Figure 15.18 shows the mechanism of electrophilic addition.

Figure 15.18: The mechanism of the electrophilic addition of bromine to ethene.

As the new bond between the C and Br atom forms, the Br─Br bond breaks heterolytically (see Section
14.7). The Br− ion formed then attacks the highly reactive carbocation intermediate. So, one bromine atom
bonds to each carbon atom, producing 1,2-dibromoethane.

15.4 Oxidation of the alkenes
Alkenes can be oxidised by acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution, KMnO4(aq), which is a powerful
oxidising agent. The products formed will depend on the conditions chosen for the reaction. In Figure 15.18,
the R, R1 and R2 are alkyl groups.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 15.1
Cold dilute acidified manganate(VII) solution
If an alkene is shaken with a dilute solution of acidified potassium manganate(VII), KMnO4(aq), at room
temperature, the pale purple solution turns colourless. The alkene is converted into a diol, i.e. a
compound with two alcohol (O─H) groups:

This reaction can be used as a test to find out whether a compound is unsaturated. However, the
decolourisation of bromine water is a more commonly used test (see Section 15.3).

Hot concentrated acidified manganate(VII) solution, KMnO4
Under these harsher conditions, the C═C double bond in the alkene is broken completely. The O─H groups
in the diol formed initially are further oxidised to ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids or carbon dioxide
gas. The actual products depend on what is bonded to the carbon atoms in the C═C double bond.
Figure 15.19 shows the oxidation products from each type of group bonded to a carbon atom in the C═C
bond.

Figure 15.19: Oxidation of alkenes with hot, concentrated potassium manganate(VII) solution, KMnO4(aq).

To see what is formed when we heat 2-methylprop-1-ene with hot, concentrated acidified KMnO4(aq), look
at equations 1 and 3 in Figure 15.19. The actual oxidation can be represented as:
═

═

We can use this reaction to determine the position of the double bond in larger alkenes. To do this we
would need to identify the products of the oxidation reaction and work backwards to deduce the original
alkene.
If, for example, carbon dioxide is given off in the oxidation, this tells us that the double bond was between
the end two carbon atoms in the alkene.
We can summarise the oxidations under harsh conditions (using a hot, concentrated solution of potassium
manganate(VII)) in three reactions.
1 If a carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, we get oxidation to a CO2 molecule.
H2C═CH2 → CO2 + CO2
2 If a carbon atom is bonded to one hydrogen atom and one alkyl group, we get oxidation to a COOH
(carboxylic acid) group.

RHC═CHR → RCHO + RCHO → RCOOH + RCOOH
3 If a carbon atom is bonded to two alkyl groups, we get oxidation to a C═O (ketone) group.
R1R2C═CR3R4 → R1R2C═O + R3R4C═O

15.5 Addition polymerisation
Probably the most important addition reaction of the alkenes forms the basis of much of the plastics
industry. Molecules of ethene, as well as other unsaturated compounds, can react with each other under
the right conditions to form polymer molecules.
A polymer is a long-chain molecule made up of many repeating units. The small, reactive molecules that
react together to make the polymer are called monomers. Up to 10 000 ethene monomers can bond
together to form the polymer chains of poly(ethene). Poly(ethene) is commonly used to make carrier bags.
We can show the polymerisation reaction of ethene as:

or by using the displayed formulae:

The section of the polymer shown in the brackets is the repeat unit of the polymer.
The reaction is called addition polymerisation. As in other addition reactions of the alkenes, it involves
the breaking of the π bond in each C═C bond. Then the monomers link together.
Other alkenes and substituted alkenes also polymerise to make polymers with different properties.
Examples of other poly(alkenes) include poly(propene) and poly(chloroethene).
We can show the polymerisation of propene as:
nC3H6 → [ C3H6 ]

n

or, using structural formulae:
═

The polymer chain has methyl (─CH3) groups sticking out from the carbon skeleton of the poly(propene).
We can show this as in Figure 15.20.

Figure 15.20: This shows a regular arrangement of the methyl groups along the poly(propene) polymer chain.

We can also represent the polymer by showing part of its structure using a 3D displayed formula, as shown
in Figure 15.21.

Figure 15.21: A 3D displayed formula of a small section of the poly(propene) molecule.

Question
7

Which one of the following statements is correct?
Discuss all the options with a partner, and explain why each is either correct or incorrect.
A

Poly(propene) and poly(ethene) will both decolorise bromine water.

B

Poly(ethene) is a saturated hydrocarbon.

C

Poly(propene) will melt at a lower temperature than propene.

D

The polymerisation of ethene is an example of an electrophilic substitution reaction.

More about addition polymers
We can also use substituted alkenes, such as chloroethene, as monomers:
═

The [ H2C─CHCl ] section of the polymer chain is the called the repeat unit of poly(chloroethene)
(Figure 15.22).

Figure 15.22: A 3D displayed formula of a small section of the poly(chloroethene) molecule. Its common name is PVC, as
the old name for chloroethene was vinyl chloride.

In poly(alkenes) and substituted poly(alkenes) made of one type of monomer, the repeat unit is the same
as the monomer except that the C═C double bond is changed to a C─C single bond.
Notice that, as in any other addition reaction of the alkenes, addition polymerisation yields only one
product.

IMPORTANT
Remember that:
the section of the polymer chain shown inside the square brackets by its structural or displayed
formula is called its repeat unit
addition polymerisation is characterised by:
monomers which are unsaturated, e.g. contain a C═C double bond
the polymer being the only product of the reaction.

Disposal of poly(alkene) plastics
Plastics are widely used in many aspects of everyday life. However, the large-scale use of poly(alkene)s
has created a problem when we come to dispose of them. During their life, one of the most useful
properties of poly(alkene)s is their lack of reactivity.
As poly(alkene)s are effectively huge alkane molecules, they are resistant to chemical attack. So they can
take hundreds of years to decompose when dumped in landfill sites, taking up valuable space. They are
non-biodegradable. Therefore, throwing away poly(alkenes) creates rubbish that will pollute the
environment for centuries (Figure 15.23).

Figure 15.23: A beach littered with poly(alkene) plastic waste.

Burning plastic waste
One way to solve this problem would be to burn the poly(alkene)s and use the energy released to generate
electricity. As we have seen in Section 15.2, if hydrocarbons burn in excess oxygen, the products are
carbon dioxide and water. This solution would not help combat global warming, but would help to conserve
our supplies of fossil fuels that currently generate most of our electricity. However, we have also seen that
toxic carbon monoxide is produced from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons.
Another problem is the difficulty recycling companies have in separating other plastic waste from the
poly(alkene)s. This happens when objects have just been thrown away and not been sorted according to
their recycling code. Also, if poly(chloroethene) waste is burnt, acidic hydrogen chloride gas will be given

off, as well as toxic compounds called dioxins. Acidic gases should be neutralised before releasing the
waste gases into the atmosphere. Very high temperatures should be used in incinerators to break down
any toxins.

15.6 Tackling questions on addition polymers
In your exam, you might be asked to:
1 deduce the repeat unit of a polymer obtained from a given unsaturated monomer
2 identify the monomer(s) present in a given section of a polymer molecule.

Deducing the repeat unit of an addition polymer for given
monomer(s)
If you are given a monomer with a C═C double bond, simply turn the double bond into a C─C single bond
and show the bonds either side of the two C atoms that would continue the chain:

Identifying the monomer(s) present in a given section of an
addition polymer molecule
First of all, you should split the polymer chain into its repeat units.
With an addition polymer, you then need to put the C═C double bond back into the monomer:

Use this exercise to give you an idea of your understanding of the key reactions of alkanes and
alkenes. What have you learned from the activity?

SUMMARY
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2.
Alkanes are relatively unreactive as they are non-polar. Most reagents are polar and do not usually react with nonpolar molecules.
Alkanes are widely used as fuels. When they burn completely they produce carbon dioxide and water. However,
they produce toxic carbon monoxide gas when they burn in a limited supply of oxygen, e.g. in a car engine.
Cracking of the less useful fractions from the fractional distillation of crude oil produces a range of more useful
alkanes with lower molecular masses, as well as alkenes.
Chlorine atoms or bromine atoms can substitute for hydrogen atoms in alkanes in the presence of ultraviolet light,
producing halogenoalkanes. This is called a free-radical substitution reaction. The Cl─Cl or Br─Br bond undergoes
homolytic fission in ultraviolet light, producing reactive Cl· or Br· free radicals. This initiation step is followed by
propagation steps involving a chain reaction which regenerates the halogen free radicals. Termination steps occur,
when two free radicals combine.
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with one carbon–carbon double bond consisting of a σ bond and a π bond.
Their general formula is CnH2n.
Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they contain a π bond. The characteristic reaction of the alkenes is
addition, which occurs across the π bond:
ethene produces ethane when heated with hydrogen gas over a platinum / nickel catalyst: this is called
hydrogenation
ethene produces 1,2-dibromoethane when reacted with bromine water at room temperature
ethene produces chloroethane when reacted with hydrogen chloride gas at room temperature
ethene produces ethanol when reacted with steam, in the presence of concentrated H3PO4 catalyst.
The mechanism of the reaction of bromine with ethene is electrophilic addition. Electrophiles accept a pair of
electrons from an electron-rich atom or centre, in this case the π bond. A carbocation intermediate is formed after
the addition of the first bromine atom. This rapidly reacts with a bromide ion to form 1,2-dibromoethane.
Mild oxidation of alkenes by cold, dilute acidified manganate(VII) solution gives a diol. However, a hot, concentrated
acidified manganate(VII) solution will break the C═C bond and give two oxidation products. Identifying the two
products formed will indicate the position of the C═C bond in the original alkene.
Alkenes produce many useful polymers by addition polymerisation. For example, poly(ethene) is made from
CH2═CH2, and poly(chloroethene) is made from CH2═CHCl.
The disposal of poly(alkene) plastic waste is difficult, as much of it is chemically inert and non-biodegradable. When
burnt, waste plastics may produce toxic products, such as hydrogen chloride from PVC, poly(chloroethene).

USES OF HALOGENOALKANES
Halogenoalkanes are used in many industrial chemical processes. Halogenoalkanes are formed from
elements such as fluorine and chlorine but, unlike these elements, many halogenoalkanes are
relatively unreactive under normal conditions. This leads to their use as flame retardants and
anaesthetics.
You might have heard of one of the first anaesthetics, chloroform. Its systematic name is
trichloromethane (CHCl3). Nowadays, if you require an anaesthetic, you may receive a gas known as
‘halothane’. Its systematic name is 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane.

One of the essential properties of an anaesthetic (Figure 16.1) is chemical inertness (lack of reactivity),
and each halothane molecule contains three very strong C─F bonds that are difficult to break. This
makes halothane inert (very unreactive) and safe to use in the aqueous environment inside the body.

Figure 16.1: An anaesthetist putting a patient to sleep before an operation.

However, under other conditions, such as high in the Earth’s stratosphere, some halogenoalkanes
react in completely different ways.
CFCs are chlorofluorocarbons. Chemists refer to them as chlorofluoroalkanes. When scientists
developed these new compounds in the 1930s, people could see no drawbacks to using the new
‘wonder compounds’. They are all chemically inert. They are not flammable and are not toxic. These
properties made volatile CFCs useful as aerosol propellants, solvents and as the refrigerants inside
fridges. They were also used as blowing agents for polymers such as expanded polystyrene.
However, CFCs have caused a serious environmental issue. They have damaged the ozone layer in the
upper atmosphere. The ozone layer is a thin layer of gas that protects the Earth by absorbing harmful
UV radiation arriving from the Sun.
It turns out that CFCs are unreactive in normal conditions, but high up in the atmosphere they become
totally different. The CFCs can persist in the atmosphere for about a hundred years. The UV light from
the Sun breaks the C─Cl bonds in the CFC molecules. This releases highly reactive chlorine atoms,
called chlorine free radicals. These chlorine free radicals react with ozone molecules. In a sequence of
chain reactions, chemists estimate that each chlorine free radical can destroy a million ozone
molecules.
Governments have been working on the problem, and most industrialised countries have now banned
the use of CFCs (Figure 16.2). Chemists developed new compounds for fridges and aerosols, such as
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs): for example, CH2FCF3. These non-chlorinated compounds break down
more quickly once released into the air because of the presence of hydrogen in their molecules. This
means that they never rise in the atmosphere as far as the ozone layer. There is now evidence that the
ozone layer is recovering from the effects of CFCs. The hole in the ozone layer is slowly closing up.

Figure 16.2: Banning the use of CFCs has meant that the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica is now getting

smaller.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Discuss how the passage above about the use of halogenoalkanes demonstrates how some
scientific developments can have both good and bad effects on society and the environment.

16.1 Making halogenoalkanes
Very few halogenoalkanes are found in nature. Most are made in chemical reactions between other organic
compounds and a halogen or halide compound.
The main reactions are:
the free-radical substitution of alkanes by chlorine, Cl2, or bromine, Br2, in ultraviolet light:
C2H6 + Cl2

C2H5Cl + HCl

(For more details, see Section 15.2)
the electrophilic addition of an alkene with a halogen, X2, or a hydrogen halide, HX(g), at room
temperature:
C2H4 + Br2 → C2H4Br2
(For more details, see Section 15.3)
substitution of an alcohol. For example, by reactions:
with HX (or with KX and H2SO4 or H3PO4 to make HX),
CH3CH2OH + HCl → CH3CH2Cl + H2O
with PCl3 and heat:

with PCl5 at room temperature:
C2H5OH + PCl5 → C2H5Cl + HCl + POCl3
or with SOCl2:
C2H5OH + SOCl2 → C2H5Cl + HCl + SO2
The chloroethane made in the reactions above is classified as a primary halogenoalkane, as the chlorine is
bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to just one alkyl group (a methyl group in this case). We can also
make halogenoalkanes where the carbon atom adjacent to the halogen atom is bonded to two alkyl groups,
called secondary halogenoalkanes. Tertiary halogenoalkanes have three alkyl groups on the adjacent
carbon atom.

16.2 Nucleophilic substitution reactions
We can think of the halogenoalkanes as alkanes that have one or more hydrogen atoms replaced by
halogen atoms.
Remember that the halogens are the elements in Group 17 of the Periodic Table, namely fluorine (F),
chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine (I).
The simplest halogenoalkanes, whose molecules contain just one halogen atom, will have the general
formula CnH2n+1X, where X is F, Cl, Br or I. The halogen atom has a huge effect on the reactivity of the
halogenoalkanes compared with that of the alkanes. The halogenoalkanes are more reactive because of
the polar nature of the covalent bond between the carbon and halogen atom unlike the non-polar bonds in
alkane molecules. The carbon bonded to the halogen carries a partial positive charge, and the halogen a
partial negative charge.

Substitution reactions with aqueous alkali, OH−(aq)
When an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide is heated with a halogenoalkane, a nucleophilic
substitution reaction takes place. The halogen atom in the halogenoalkane is replaced by an ─OH,
hydroxyl group, so the organic product formed is an alcohol:

We can also show this equation as:
CH3CH2Br + OH− → CH3CH2OH + Br−
The aqueous hydroxide ion behaves as a nucleophile here, because it is donating a pair of electrons to the
carbon atom bonded to the halogen in the halogenoalkane. This is why the reaction is called a nucleophilic
substitution.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 16.1
Hydrolysis of a halogenoalkane
The reaction is carried out under reflux in the laboratory. This lets us heat the reaction mixture without
evaporating off the volatile organic compounds in the reaction flask. The apparatus is shown in Figure
16.3.
Similar reactions occur with other halogenoalkanes, but the reaction rates differ. We can investigate
the rate of hydrolysis using aqueous silver nitrate solution. The water in the silver nitrate solution acts
as the nucleophile, and again an alcohol is formed. The reaction is called hydrolysis (meaning
‘breakdown by water’):

Figure 16.3: Reflux apparatus for hydrolysis of a halogenoalkane.

CH3CH2Br + H2O → CH3CH2OH + H+ + Br−
It is a very similar reaction to the reaction that takes place with aqueous alkali.
However, the hydrolysis with water occurs more slowly than with the hydroxide ion, OH−(aq). This is
because the negatively charged hydroxide ion is a more effective nucleophile than a neutral water
molecule. This is due to the fact that, in water, the oxygen atom in H2O only carries partial negative
charge (δ−), whereas in the hydroxide ion, OH−, the oxygen atom carries a full negative charge.
From the equation above, you can see that a halide ion, in this case the bromide ion, Br−, is produced
in the reaction.
In Section 12.3 we used silver nitrate solution to test for halide ions. Remember that:
aqueous chlorides give a white precipitate (silver chloride),
bromides give a cream precipitate (silver bromide)
iodides produce a pale yellow precipitate (silver iodide).
The water in the silver nitrate solution will hydrolyse the halogenoalkane.
Observing this reaction, we can time how long it takes for test-tubes containing the halogenoalkanes and
aqueous silver nitrate solution to become opaque.

Conclusion
We find that:
the fastest nucleophilic substitution reactions take place with the iodoalkanes

the slowest nucleophilic substitution reactions take place with the fluoroalkanes.
The substitution reaction involves the breaking of the carbon–halogen bond. The bond energies in Table
16.1 help us to explain the rates of reaction:
Bond

Bond energy / kJ mol−1

C─F

467 (strongest bond)

C─Cl

346

C─Br

290

C─I

228 (weakest bond)

Table 16.1: Bond energy values of the carbon–halogen bonds.

Notice that the C─I bond is the weakest, so it is broken most easily. When the C─I bond breaks, it forms an I
−
ion during the substitution reaction. The bond breaks heterolytically, with the iodine atom taking both the
electrons in the C─I bond.
This is shown clearly in an ionic equation:

IMPORTANT
The trend in the reactivity of the halogenoalkanes is shown below:

There is more about the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in Section 16.3.

Substitution with cyanide ions, CN− (in ethanol)
In this reaction the nucleophile is the cyanide, CN−, ion. To carry out the reaction, a solution of potassium
cyanide, KCN, in ethanol (known as an ethanolic solution of potassium cyanide) is made up. This is then
heated under reflux with the halogenoalkane.
An ionic equation for this reaction is:

Notice that the reaction with the cyanide ion adds an extra carbon atom to the original halogenoalkane
carbon chain. In this case, bromoethane is converted to propanenitrile.
Sometimes in industry, chemists need to make a new compound with one more carbon atom than the best
available organic raw material (the starting compound). Therefore, if we can convert the starting
compound to a halogenoalkane, we can then reflux with ethanolic KCN to make a nitrile. We now have an
intermediate nitrile with the correct number of carbon atoms.
We will consider nitriles and their subsequent conversion to carboxylic acids and amines again in Chapter
18.

Substitution with ammonia, NH3 (in ethanol)
If we heat a halogenoalkane with an excess of ammonia dissolved in ethanol under pressure, an amine is
formed.

Here the nucleophile is the ammonia, NH3, molecule. The organic product, ethylamine, is a primary amine,
as the nitrogen atom is attached to only one alkyl group. If the ammonia is not in excess, we get a mixture
of amine products. This is because the primary amine product will act as a nucleophile itself and will attack
halogenoalkane molecules, forming secondary amines, and so on. The secondary amine formed above
would be (CH3CH2)2NH, called diethylamine.
You can read more about amines in Chapter 27.

together.

16.3 Mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in
halogenoalkanes
Many of the reactions of halogenoalkanes are nucleophilic substitutions. In these reactions, the nucleophile
attacks the carbon atom bonded to the halogen. Remember from Chapter 14 that nucleophiles are donors
of an electron pair, and are attracted to electron-deficient atoms.
The carbon–halogen bond is polarised because the halogen is more electronegative than carbon. So the
halogen draws the pair of electrons in the bond away from the carbon atom, nearer to itself. Therefore, the
carbon atom carries a positive charge (shown in Figure 16.4).

Figure 16.4: The carbon–halogen bond is polarised.

The halogen atom is replaced by the nucleophile in the substitution reaction.
There are two possible mechanisms that can operate in the nucleophilic substitution reactions of
halogenoalkanes. The actual mechanism is determined by the structure of the halogenoalkane involved in
the reaction.

Mechanism for primary halogenoalkanes (SN2)
In primary halogenoalkanes containing one halogen atom, the halogen atom is bonded to a carbon atom,
which is itself bonded to one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. This means that the carbon
atom bonded to the halogen is attached to only one alkyl group. For example, 1-chloropropane,
CH3CH2CH2Cl, is a primary halogenoalkane. In this case, the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom is
attached to one alkyl group, an ethyl group.
In Section 16.2 we looked at the hydrolysis of bromoethane, another primary halogenoalkane. Figure 16.5
shows the mechanism for that reaction.

Figure 16.5: The mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in a primary halogenoalkane.

The OH− ion donates a pair of electrons to the δ+ carbon atom, forming a new covalent bond. At the same
time, the C─Br bond is breaking. The Br atom takes both the electrons in the bond. This is an example of
heterolytic fission of a covalent bond (see Section 14.7). The Br atom leaves the halogenoalkane as a Br
− ion.

This mechanism is called an SN2 mechanism. The ‘S’ stands for substitution and the ‘N’ stands for
nucleophilic. The ‘2’ tells us that the rate of the reaction, which is determined by the slow step in the
mechanism (see Section 22.1), involves two reacting species. Experiments show us that the rate depends
on both the concentration of the halogenoalkane and the concentration of the hydroxide ions present.

Mechanism for tertiary halogenoalkanes (SN1)
In a tertiary halogenoalkane, the carbon atom bonded to the halogen atom is also bonded to three other
carbon atoms (alkyl groups). For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane is a tertiary halogenoalkane. The
carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom is attached to three alkyl groups, all methyl groups. The
structure of this tertiary halogenoalkane is shown in Figure 16.6.

Figure 16.6: A tertiary halogenoalkane, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane.

A tertiary halogenoalkane reacts with a hydroxide ion by a two-step mechanism. The first step in the
mechanism is the breaking of the carbon–halogen bond. This forms a tertiary carbocation (see Section
14.7). Then the tertiary carbocation is attacked immediately by the hydroxide ion (Figure 16.7).

Figure 16.7: The mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in a tertiary halogenoalkane.

This mechanism is known as an SN1 mechanism. The ‘1’ tells us that the rate of the reaction only
depends on one reagent, in this case the concentration of the halogenoalkane, as shown in the first (slow)
step of the mechanism.
Once again, this breaking of the C─Br bond is an example of heterolytic fission.
The Br− ion forms again, as in the SN2 mechanism, but in this mechanism a carbocation ion forms. This
does not happen with primary halogenoalkanes. This is because tertiary carbocations are more stable than
primary carbocations. This is due to the positive inductive effect of the alkyl groups attached to the
carbon atom bonded to the halogen (see Section 14.5). Alkyl groups tend to release electrons to atoms
attached to them. So a tertiary carbocation has three alkyl groups donating electrons towards the
positively charged carbon atom, reducing its charge density. This makes it more stable than a primary
carbocation, which just has one alkyl group releasing electrons (Figure 16.8).

Figure 16.8: The trend in the stability of primary, secondary and tertiary carbocations.

The SN1 mechanism and the SN2 mechanism are both likely to play a part in the nucleophilic substitution of
secondary halogenoalkanes.

b

Draw the structure (displayed formula) of 2-chloro-2-methylbutane.

c

Show the mechanism for the hydrolysis of 2-chloro-2-methylbutane by an alkali.

16.4 Elimination reactions
Halogenoalkanes also undergo elimination reactions. An elimination reaction involves the loss of a small
molecule from the original organic molecule. In the case of halogenoalkanes, this small molecule is a
hydrogen halide, such as HCl or HBr.
The reagent used in these elimination reactions is ethanolic sodium hydroxide, heated with the
halogenoalkane:
═

The original bromoethane molecule has lost an H atom and a Br atom. We can think of it as HBr being
eliminated from the halogenoalkane. The ethanolic OH− ion acts as a base, accepting an H+ ion from the
halogenoalkane to form water.
The C─Br bond breaks heterolytically, forming a Br− ion and leaving an alkene as the organic product.
Notice the importance of the conditions used in organic reactions:

IMPORTANT
If we use NaOH(ethanol), an elimination reaction occurs and an alkene is one of the products.
but
If we use NaOH(aq), a nucleophilic substitution reaction occurs and an alcohol is one of the products.

and tertiary halogenoalkanes.

hydrolysis of a primary halogenoalkane and a tertiary halogenoalkane by an alkali. Make a list of
the essential knowledge to answer an exam question on SN2 and SN1 mechanisms.

SUMMARY
If one or more of the hydrogen atoms in an alkane molecule are replaced by halogen atoms, the compound is called
a halogenoalkane.
Iodoalkanes are the most reactive halogenoalkanes, whereas fluoroalkanes are the least reactive. We explain this by
the trend in the bond strength of the carbon.halogen bonds. The C─F bond is the strongest bond, and the C─I bond
is the weakest bond. So the C─I bond is most easily broken during its reactions.
Halogenoalkanes are attacked by nucleophiles. This happens because the carbon bonded to the halogen carries a
partial positive charge (δ+), due to the higher electronegativity of the halogen. So halogenoalkanes can undergo
nucleophilic substitution.
Suitable nucleophiles include aqueous alkali, OH−(aq), cyanide, CN−, and ammonia, NH3.
The reaction with OH− ions (or with water) is known as hydrolysis, and an alcohol is formed as the organic product.
Halogenoalkanes will also undergo elimination reactions when heated with ethanolic sodium hydroxide, forming
alkenes as the organic product.

MAKING ETHANOL AS A BIOFUEL
Ethanol, C2H5OH, is the most widely used of the homologous series of alcohols. The sugar extracted
from crops such as sugar cane and sugar beet can be fermented with yeast to make ethanol (Figure
17.1). Ethanol is a ‘biofuel’ and burns with a clean flame. This process is becoming increasingly
important as our supplies of crude oil run out and cleaner, easier to produce biofuels are needed to
take the place of petrol and diesel.

Figure 17.1: The sugar extracted from sugar cane can be fermented with yeast to make ethanol.

The industrial production of ethanol uses ethene as a reactant. As you saw in the introduction to
Chapter 15, we get ethene by the cracking of fractions from crude oil. The ethene reacts with steam,
using a catalyst of phosphoric(V) acid, H3PO4, to make ethanol (see Section 15.3):

This is a relatively cheap, continuous process, especially for countries with their own reserves of crude
oil. But ethanol made this way still costs more than petrol, as well as using up our remaining oil
reserves.
Brazil is one country that has started making ethanol on a large scale. However, they do not use
ethene. They start with sugar extracted from sugar cane. The sugar solution is fermented in a batch
process with yeast to produce ethanol as fuel for cars. The fermentation only needs a warm
temperature to take place.
The ethanol made needs to be distilled from the reaction mixture. This requires energy but more sugar
cane (or sugar beet in colder climates) can be grown each year. So ethanol made this way is a
renewable biofuel, unlike fossil fuels.
The ethanol itself can be used in cars with adapted engines or in normal cars as a mixture with petrol.
But the environment could really benefit if we start using more ethanol as a fuel. The huge volume of
carbon dioxide given off from fossil fuels is causing global climate change. But carbon dioxide is also
given off during the fermentation of sugar, as well as when ethanol burns:

However, the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is offset by carbon dioxide absorbed during
photosynthesis as sugar cane grows:

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
It is difficult to achieve 100% carbon-neutrality, a perfect balance between CO2 released and CO2
absorbed. This might be because fossil fuels are often used in manufacturing fertilisers, harvesting

and transporting the crops for processing, and distributing the ethanol.
Discuss in small groups how we could make ethanol biofuel even more environmentally friendly.
Make a list of suggestions to share with the whole group.

17.1 The homologous series of alcohols
Alcohols are organic molecules containing the hydroxyl group, OH. With one hydroxyl group substituted
into an alkane molecule, the general formula is CnH2n+1OH.
The alcohols are named by adding ‘-anol’ to the alkane stem. For example, CH3OH is called methanol.

Classifying alcohols
For alcohol molecules with three or more carbon atoms, the position of the hydroxyl group is shown by
inserting a number to indicate which carbon atom is bonded to the ─OH group. Figure 17.2 gives some
examples.

Figure 17.2: Note that the numbering to show the position of the ─OH group in an alcohol starts from the end of the
molecule that gives the smaller number.

Propan-1-ol is classified as a primary alcohol. The carbon atom bonded to the ─OH group is attached to
one other carbon atom (alkyl group). Propan-2-ol is a secondary alcohol as the carbon atom bonded to
the ─OH group is attached to two other carbon atoms (alkyl groups). With three alkyl groups attached, 2methylpropan-2-ol is an example of a tertiary alcohol.
There are also alcohols with more than one ─OH group. We came across an example in Section 15.4 when
an alkene is oxidised to form a ‘diol’, ethane-1,2-diol. Its structural formula is HOCH2CH2OH. Both the
hydroxy groups are bonded to a ─CH2 group, so both are classified as primary. On the other hand, a diol
such as propane-1,2-diol, HOCH2CH(OH)CH3, has one primary and one secondary ─OH group within its
molecules.

Properties of alcohols
The alcohols have higher boiling points than expected when compared with other organic molecules with
similar relative molecular masses. Even methanol, the alcohol with the lowest molar mass, is a liquid at
room temperature. This occurs because of hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules (see Section 4.8).
Hydrogen bonding also explains why the smaller alcohol molecules are so miscible (mix and dissolve well)
in water.

Comparing the acidity of alcohols and water
Once dissolved in water, ethanol molecules do not dissociate (split up) to any great extent, although there
is a very small degree of dissociation:

The position of equilibrium lies well over to the left, favouring the undissociated C2H5OH molecules. Even
compared to the dissociation of water molecules:

the concentration of H+(aq) ions is much lower. So we can say that ethanol is a weaker acid than water: its

molecules are less likely to dissociate and form H+ ions. This is because of the electron-donating alkyl
(ethyl) group bonded to the negatively charged oxygen atom in the ethoxide ion. The positive inductive
effect of the ethyl group (see Section 27.1) has the effect of concentrating more negative charge on this
oxygen atom. So the ethoxide ion more readily accepts an H ion than the hydroxide ions, OH−, from the
dissociation of water. The hydroxide ion only has a hydrogen atom bonded to its negatively charged
oxygen, and no alkyl groups.

Working as a pair, with your book closed, explain to your partner why ethanol is a weaker acid than
water. Then listen while your partner talks about why water is a stronger acid than ethanol.
Finish by opening the book and checking how you did.

17.2 Reactions to make alcohols
Alcohols do occur in nature, for example, in rotting fruit that undergoes fermentation. There are also plenty
of ways that chemists can produce alcohols. Here is a summary of the reactions you need to know:
electrophilic addition of steam, H2O(g), to an alkene, using a concentrated phosphoric(V) acid, H3PO4,
catalyst (see Section 15.3):

oxidation of alkenes with cold, dilute, acidified potassium manganate(VII) to form a diol (see Section
15.4). Remember that we can use the symbol [O] to represent oxygen provided by an oxidising agent
in organic reactions:

nucleophilic substitution (hydrolysis in this case) of a halogenoalkane by heating with NaOH(aq) (see
Section 16.2):

reduction of an aldehyde (to form a primary alcohol) or of a ketone (to form a secondary alcohol) using
a reducing agent, such as NaBH4 or LiAlH4 (see Section 18.3):

reduction of a carboxylic acid using NaBH4 or LiAlH4 (see Section 17.4):

or H2(g) / Ni and heat
hydrolysis of an ester by heating with a dilute acid or alkali (see Section 17.3):

with alkali

17.3 Reactions of the alcohols
Combustion
When ignited, the alcohols react with oxygen in the air (Figure 17.3). The products of complete combustion
are carbon dioxide and water.
alcohol + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water
For example, ethanol burns with a clean blue flame in a good supply of air:

Figure 17.3: The fuel called ‘gasohol’ is a mixture of ethanol and petrol.

Substitution to form a halogenoalkane
In this substitution reaction with a hydrogen halide, such as hydrogen chloride, the ─OH group in the
alcohol is replaced by a halogen atom. This produces a halogenoalkane.

IMPORTANT
The general equation is:
alcohol + hydrogen halide → halogenoalkane + water
For example:

The dry hydrogen chloride gas for this reaction can be made in situ (in the reaction vessel). Sodium
chloride and concentrated sulfuric acid are used for this:
NaCl + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + HCl

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 17.1
Halogenation of an alcohol
The alcohol is heated under reflux (see apparatus in Section 16.2) with the reactants to make the
halogenoalkane. The halogenoalkane made can then be distilled off from the reaction mixture and
collected as oily droplets under water (Figure 17.4).

Figure 17.4: Bromoethane being distilled off following the reaction between ethanol and hydrogen bromide. The
white solid visible in the pear-shaped flask is sodium bromide (crystals). The sodium bromide reacts with concentrated
sulfuric or phosphoric(V) acid to make the hydrogen bromide needed for the reaction.

For a substitution reaction with hydrogen bromide, the HBr can be made using potassium bromide and
concentrated phosphoric (or sulfuric) acid.
The nucleophilic substitution by the halide ion takes place after the ─OH group has accepted an H+ ion
from the acid. This makes the C─O bond in the alcohol easier to break, and water is given off.
Sulfur dichloride oxide, SOCl2, can also be used to substitute a chlorine atom into an alcohol molecule, as
shown below:
C2H5OH + SOCl2 → C2H5Cl + HCl + SO2
Note that in this reaction the two by-products of the reaction (HCl and SO2) are both gases. These gases
escape from the reaction mixture. The halogenoalkane is formed, without the need to heat the reaction
mixture.
We can also use phosphorus halides to provide the halogen atoms for this substitution reaction with
alcohols.
For chloroalkanes we can use solid phosphorus(V) chloride, PCl5:
C2H5OH + PCl5 → C2H5Cl + HCl + POCl3
The release of acidic hydrogen chloride gas from this reaction can be used as a test for the hydroxyl group.
You can see acidic steamy fumes from the HCl gas produced.
Phosphorus(III) chloride can also be used to halogenate an alcohol, but this reaction does require heating.
3C2H5OH + PCl3

3C2H5Cl + H3PO3

For bromoalkanes and iodoalkanes, we can make the phosphorus(III) halide, PBr3 or PI3, needed for the
reaction. Red phosphorus and bromine or iodine are warmed with the alcohol.
For example:

However, in some other reactions the O─H bond in the alcohol breaks. The reaction with sodium metal is an
example:

The reaction is similar to sodium’s reaction with water, but less vigorous. In both cases hydrogen gas is
given off and a basic ionic compound is formed. With ethanol, if the excess ethanol is allowed to evaporate
off after the reaction, a white crystalline solid is left. This is sodium ethoxide.
Other alcohols react in a similar way with sodium. For example, propan-1-ol would produce sodium
propoxide plus hydrogen gas.

IMPORTANT
In general:
alcohol + sodium → sodium alkoxide + hydrogen
We find that the longer the hydrocarbon chain in the alcohol, the less vigorous the reaction with sodium
metal (Figure 17.5).

Figure 17.5: Sodium reacting with ethanol. The pink colour is from a colourless phenolphthalein indicator that has been
added to the ethanol, showing the basic nature of the sodium ethoxide formed in the ethanol.

Describe what you would observe.

b

c

Suggest what difference you would see if you used sodium instead of lithium in this reaction.

Esterification

Another reaction that involves the breaking of the O─H bond in alcohols is esterification, i.e. the making
of esters. An esterification reaction can take place between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. It can be
classified as a condensation reaction.

IMPORTANT
The general equation is:

REFLECTION
1

At this point, review your knowledge of the reactions of the alcohols covered so far in this chapter.
Go back to Section 17.2 ‘Reactions to make alcohols’ and look at each chemical equation since
then, covering the products with a sheet of paper. Try to complete each equation on your sheet of
paper, checking your answers as you go along. How did you do?

2

If you know the type of reaction taking place it is a lot easier to identify the products formed.
Discuss with a partner any strategies you have found useful to help remember organic equations.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 17.2
Alcohol plus carboxylic acid
For esterification to take place, the carboxylic acid and alcohol are heated under reflux with a strong
acid catalyst (usually concentrated sulfuric acid, but also phosphoric(V) acid). The reaction is
reversible, so an equilibrium mixture can be established with all the reactants and products shown in
the general equation present.
The esters formed usually have sweet, fruity smells.
Here is an example of an esterification reaction:

The ester formed is called ethyl ethanoate.
But what would be the name of the ester formed if ethanol was reacted with propanoic acid?
Would it be propyl ethanoate or ethyl propanoate?
The answer is ethyl propanoate. That’s because the first part of an ester’s name comes from the alcohol: in
this case ethanol, giving ‘ethyl …’. The second part comes from the carboxylic acid, in this case propanoic
acid, giving ‘… propanoate’. This makes ‘ethyl propanoate’ as the name of the ester formed (Figure 17.6).

Figure 17.6: Esters contribute to the complex mixture of substances blended in a perfume. They are also present
naturally in fruits, and we use them in artificial flavourings and as solvents, e.g. in nail varnish remover.

Hydrolysis of esters
IMPORTANT
Esters can be hydrolysed by heating under reflux with either an acid or a base.
Refluxing with an acid, such as dilute sulfuric acid, simply reverses the preparation of the ester from an
alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The reaction is reversible and an equilibrium mixture is established. In acid
hydrolysis, there are always both reactants (ester + water) and products (carboxylic acid + alcohol)
present after the reaction.
The equation for the acid hydrolysis of the ester ethyl ethanoate is:

However, when an ester is refluxed with an alkali (a soluble base), such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, it is

fully hydrolysed. Unlike acid hydrolysis, this is not a reversible reaction, so all the ester present can be
broken down by excess alkali. An alcohol and the sodium salt of the carboxylic acid are formed.
The equation for the base hydrolysis of ethyl ethanoate is:

Question

b

Name the ester formed in each of the following reactions :
i

butan-1-ol + ethanoic acid

ii

ethanol + hexanoic acid

iii

pentan-1-ol and methanoic acid.

Write the structural formula of each ester formed in part a.

Dehydration
Alcohols can also undergo elimination reactions in which water is lost, and in this case, alkenes are formed.
As the small molecule removed from the alcohol molecule is H2O, this reaction is also known as
dehydration.

The reaction takes place when alcohol vapour is passed over a hot catalyst of aluminium oxide powder.
Pieces of porous pot or pumice, as well as a concentrated acid, also catalyse the reaction.
For example:
═

Figure 17.7 shows how you would collect the ethene gas formed.

Figure 17.7: The dehydration of ethanol to give ethene.

Question
5

Concentrated sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid can be used to catalyse the dehydration of an alcohol.
The alcohol and concentrated acid are heated to about 170 °C. The concentrated acid does not
change chemically during the reaction.
a

Write an equation showing the dehydration of ethanol using concentrated sulfuric acid.

b

If propan-1-ol was used instead of ethanol, name the organic product formed.

Oxidation
In Section 17.1 we saw how alcohols can be classified as primary, secondary or tertiary. For most of their
reactions, the class of alcohol makes no difference to the type of products formed. In organic chemistry, we
can usually generalise for the whole homologous series. However, when alcohols are oxidised, primary,
secondary and tertiary alcohols each behave differently.

IMPORTANT
Primary and secondary alcohols can be oxidised by potassium dichromate(VI) solution, K2Cr2O7,
acidified with dilute sulfuric acid. Tertiary alcohols are not oxidised by acidified potassium
dichromate(VI) solution.
The orange colour of acidified potassium dichromate(VI) solution is caused by the dichromate(VI) ions,
Cr2O72−(aq). When the dichromate(VI) ions behave as an oxidising agent, the ions themselves are reduced.
They become chromium(III) ions, Cr3+(aq), which form a green solution. The reaction mixture needs to be
warmed before the oxidation takes place.

The product formed when you attempt to oxidise an alcohol can be used to distinguish between primary,
secondary and tertiary alcohols.
With tertiary alcohols, a mixture of the tertiary alcohol, dilute sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate(VI)
solution remains orange when warmed. No reaction takes place.
A secondary alcohol, such as propan-2-ol, will be oxidised to form a ketone. In this case propanone is
formed and the reaction mixture turns green:

Remember that simplified oxidation equations use [O] to show the oxygen added from the oxidising agent
(see Section 14.8).
With a primary alcohol, such as ethanol, the alcohol is oxidised to an aldehyde. Ethanol is oxidised to
ethanal:

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 17.3
Distinguishing tertiary alcohols
Given three unknown alcohols, one primary, one secondary and one tertiary, it is easy to distinguish
the tertiary alcohol. Figure 17.8 shows the results of warming each class of alcohol with a solution of
acidified potassium dichromate(VI).

Figure 17.8: Before warming with the labelled alcohol, each of these tubes contained orange acidified potassium
dichromate(VI) solution. After warming, the orange dichromate(VI) ions have been reduced to green chromium(III) ions
by the primary and secondary alcohols. This shows that both the primary and secondary alcohols have been oxidised,
but the tertiary alcohol, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, has not.

The ethanal formed can be further oxidised to form ethanoic acid, a carboxylic acid. This is achieved by
refluxing with excess acidified potassium dichromate(VI):

Question

Working with a partner, discuss and answer these questions:

Propan-1-ol can be oxidised to propanal, CH3CH2CHO, and then further oxidised to propanoic acid,
CH3CH2COOH.

c

agent as [O].

17.4 Carboxylic acids
Reactions that form carboxylic acids
We have already seen how primary alcohols can be oxidised to aldehydes, which are then further oxidised
to form carboxylic acids. The primary alcohol is refluxed with acidified potassium chromate(VI) solution (or
acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution.
Carboxylic acids are also made from nitriles, R─C≡N. When a nitrile is refluxed with dilute hydrochloric acid,
hydrolysis occurs. The —C≡N group at the end of the hydrocarbon chain is converted to the —COOH group,
forming a carboxylic acid (see Section 18.4).
For example:

Reacting as typical acids
Carboxylic acids are described as weak acids because their molecules do not dissociate (ionise) completely
when added to water. However, a small proportion of the molecules do dissociate. The carboxylic acid
molecules then release H+(aq) ions. The solutions made have a pH value less than 7. For example,
ethanoic acid forms aqueous hydrogen ions and ethanoate ions in water:

You can learn more about the dissociation of carboxylic acids in Chapter 26.
The presence of excess H+(aq) ions in solutions of carboxylic acids means that they undergo all the usual
reactions of acids. They react with:
alkalis to form a salt and water:
CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O
reactive metals to form a salt and hydrogen gas:
2CH3COOH + Mg → (CH3COO)2Mg + H2
carbonates to form a salt, water and carbon dioxide gas:
2CH3COOH + K2CO3 → 2CH3COOK + H2O + CO2
The salts formed in the three reactions above are called sodium ethanoate, magnesium ethanoate and
potassium ethanoate, respectively.

Reduction of carboxylic acids
Carboxylic acids can be reduced to their corresponding primary alcohol by using the reducing agent lithium
tetrahydridoaluminate, LiAlH4, in dry ether at room temperature. The liquid ether is dried because LiAlH4
reacts violently with any water present.
In the simplified reduction equation, you can use the symbol [H] to represent the hydrogen atoms from the
reducing agent. Remember that in organic chemistry, you can think of reduction as the addition of
hydrogen atoms.
So, for ethanoic acid being reduced to ethanol, we can show the reaction as:
CH3COOH + 4[H] → CH3CH2OH + H2O

Question

alcohols.

REFLECTION
1

Make a mind map to summarise the oxidation and reduction of alcohols. Label the links with the
reaction conditions needed. Ensure you include how alcohols are formed, as well as the products
made when alcohols themselves are oxidised and reduced.
Check your mind maps with a partner and revise your own if necessary. What did your partner
particularly notice about your mind map?

2

Reflect on the use of the symbols [O] and [H] in organic reactions. Discuss with your partner how
these symbols help you to identify the products of reduction and oxidation and make organic
chemistry easier to understand.

SUMMARY
The complete combustion of alcohols forms carbon dioxide and water.
A nucleophilic substitution reaction takes place between alcohols and hydrogen halides to form halogenoalkanes.
Alcohols react with sodium metal to give sodium alkoxides and hydrogen gas.
An alcohol will react with a carboxylic acid, in the presence of a strong acid catalyst, to form an ester and water.
Esters can be hydrolysed by an acid or by a base. Acid hydrolysis is a reversible reaction but base hydrolysis is not
reversible.
Elimination of water from an alcohol produces an alkene; the reaction is called dehydration. Dehydration may be
carried out by passing alcohol vapour over heated pumice, porous pot or aluminium oxide, or by using a
concentrated acid catalysts.
A primary alcohol can be oxidised to an aldehyde by heating the alcohol gently with acidified potassium
dichromate(VI) (and distilling out the aldehyde as it forms: see Section 18.2). The primary alcohol can be further
oxidised to a carboxylic acid by refluxing the alcohol with excess acidified potassium dichromate(VI).
A secondary alcohol can be oxidised to a ketone by heating the alcohol with acidified potassium dichromate(VI).
Acidified potassium dichromate(VI) changes colour from orange to green when it oxidises a primary or secondary
alcohol. However, tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidised by refluxing with acidified potassium dichromate(VI).
Carboxylic acids can be formed from the oxidation of primary alcohols or aldehydes by refluxing with excess
potassium dichromate(VI) and dilute sulfuric(VI) acid. They can also be made by refluxing nitriles with dilute
hydrochloric acid.
Carboxylic acids are weak acids that react with reactive metals, alkalis or carbonates to form carboxylate salts.
The carboxylic acids can be reduced by LiAlH4 in dry ether, to form primary alcohols.

USING ALDEHYDES AND KETONES
Aromatic carbonyl compounds have very distinctive, almond-like odours. Benzaldehyde is used to
make almond essence, the flavouring used in some cakes and puddings. Benzaldehyde is also a
component of the mixtures that make up the smells and flavours of many fruits such as mangoes,
cherries, apricots, plums and peaches. The structures of heptan-2-one and benzaldehyde are shown in
Figure 18.1.
More complex aldehydes and ketones also occur in common smells and flavours, such as the lemony
odour of citronella candles. Citronella candles can be used to repel mosquitoes. The common name for
the aldehyde responsible for the smell is citronellal. Chemists can extract (take out) this aldehyde from
lemongrass and citronella grass. The structural formula of citronellal, with the aldehyde function group
in bold, is:
CH3C(CH3)═CHCH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CHO

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Carry out some research to find the name and structure of the aldehyde responsible for the sweet
smell of vanilla.
Then discuss the difference between the structures of molecules of aldehydes and ketones.
Finish by each drawing the skeletal formula of citronellal, then compare each other’s efforts.

Figure 18.1: a Heptan-2-one, a ketone, is responsible for the smell of blue cheese. b Benzaldehyde, an aldehyde,
contributes to the flavours of many fruits and nuts. You can see the structures of heptan-2-one and benzaldehyde
above from their displayed formulae.

18.1 The homologous series of aldehydes and
ketones
You briefly looked at aldehydes and ketones, the main classes of carbonyl compounds, in Chapter 17.

IMPORTANT
Remember that:
aldehydes can be formed from the oxidation of primary alcohols
ketones can be formed from the oxidation of secondary alcohols (see Section 18.2).

In aldehydes, the carbon atom in the carbonyl group, >C═O, is bonded to a carbon atom and a hydrogen
atom. In other words, the carbonyl group is positioned at the end of a carbon chain.
In ketones, the carbonyl group is attached to two other carbon atoms. Tables 18.1 and 18.2 give examples
from the start of these homologous series.

18.2 Preparation of aldehydes and ketones
Preparing aldehydes
The general equation for the reaction in which an aldehyde is made from a primary alcohol is:

IMPORTANT
primary alcohol + oxygen atom from oxidising agent → aldehyde + water
For example:

The oxidising agent used is a solution of potassium dichromate(VI), which is orange, acidified with dilute
sulfuric acid. To make the aldehyde, the primary alcohol is heated gently with acidified dichromate solution.
The reaction mixture turns green as the orange dichromate ions, Cr2O72−(aq), are reduced to green Cr3+
(aq) ions.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 18.1
Oxidation of a primary alcohol
The acidified oxidising agent is added one drop at a time to the warm primary alcohol. The aldehyde
made is distilled off as it forms in the reaction vessel. This method works because the aldehyde
product will always have a lower boiling point than the alcohol reactant. If the aldehyde is not distilled
off as soon as it is formed, further heating with acidified dichromate solution will oxidise the aldehyde
produced to a carboxylic acid. The apparatus used to prepare a sample of ethanal is shown in Figure
18.2.

Figure 18.2: Distilling off and collecting the aldehyde, ethanal, formed in the mild oxidation of a primary alcohol,
ethanol. The aqueous ethanal formed smells like rotting apples.

Preparing ketones
The general equation for making a ketone is:

IMPORTANT
secondary alcohol + oxygen atom from oxidising agent → ketone + water
For example:

Once again, the oxidising agent used is a solution of potassium dichromate(VI), acidified with dilute sulfuric
acid.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 18.2
Oxidation of a secondary alcohol
To produce a ketone, the acidified oxidising agent must be heated with a secondary alcohol. The
reaction mixture in the flask will change from orange to green.
Unlike aldehydes, the ketone formed cannot be further oxidised, even if you heat the reaction mixture
under reflux and add excess oxidising agent. Therefore, we do not need to distil off the ketone product
immediately.

Question

ii

What do you observe in the reaction vessel if the oxidising agent used in part b i is
potassium dichromate(VI) solution, acidified with dilute sulfuric acid, and the reaction
mixture is heated?

iii

Discuss each option to complete the following statement with another learner, and agree on
the correct answer:
The butanone does not have to be distilled off as it forms in the reaction vessel because …
A

… it cannot be oxidised to a carboxylic acid.

B

… it has a higher boiling point than butan-2-ol.

C

… it is easier to filter it off from the reaction mixture.

D

… it could be reduced back to butan-2-ol when heated.

18.3 Reduction of aldehydes and ketones
Chemical reduction of an aldehyde or ketone produces an alcohol:

IMPORTANT
aldehyde + reducing agent → primary alcohol
ketone + reducing agent → secondary alcohol
The reducing agent used is usually an aqueous alkaline solution of sodium tetrahydridoborate, NaBH4, or
lithium tetrahydridoaluminate, LiAlH4, in dry ether.
The reduction reaction is carried out by either:
warming the aldehyde or ketone with an aqueous alkaline solution of sodium tetrahydridoborate, or
adding lithium tetrahydridoaluminate dissolved in a dry ether, such as diethyl ether, at room
temperature. The organic solvent has to be dry because lithium tetrahydridoaluminate is a more
powerful reducing agent than sodium tetrahydridoborate and reacts vigorously in water.
In the same way that we have used the symbol [O] in organic oxidation equations, we use the symbol [H]
in reduction equations. [H] represents a hydrogen atom from the reducing agent. Look at the equations
below used to summarise these reduction reactions:

Question
3

a

Write a balanced equation for the reaction that takes place when propanal is warmed with an
aqueous alkaline solution of sodium tetrahydridoborate, using the symbol [H] to represent a
hydrogen atom from the reducing agent.

b

Name the product formed in the reduction reaction if pentan-3-one is added to lithium
tetrahydridoaluminate in dry ether.

Compare your answers with those of another learner to arrive at two agreed answers.

18.4 Nucleophilic addition with HCN
The addition reactions we have met so far have involved electrophilic addition across the C═C double bond
in alkene molecules (see Section 15.3).
Aldehydes and ketones also both undergo addition reactions with hydrogen cyanide, HCN. In these
reactions, addition of HCN takes place across the C═O bond. However, the attack is by a nucleophile, not an
electrophile.
We can show this using the nucleophilic addition reaction of the aldehyde propanal when heated with
HCN. The HCN is generated in situ (in the reaction vessel) by the reaction of potassium cyanide, KCN, and
dilute sulfuric acid.

Note that a carbon atom has been added to the propanal molecule by the addition of the nitrile group
(─C≡N). This is a useful reaction for chemists making new compounds as it increases the length of the
carbon chain in the original aldehyde molecule by one carbon atom.

IMPORTANT
The nitrile group (─C≡N) can then be easily hydrolysed to a carboxylic acid.
You can carry out the hydrolysis of the nitrile group by refluxing with dilute hydrochloric acid:

You can also hydrolyse the nitrile group by refluxing with dilute alkali, such as sodium hydroxide solution. In
this reaction a sodium salt of the carboxylic acid, ─COO−Na+, is formed. Therefore, if you want to produce
the carboxylic acid, ─COOH, the products are treated with a strong acid, such as dilute sulfuric acid.

Mechanism of nucleophilic addition
The carbonyl group, >C═O, in aldehydes and ketones is polarised due to the high electronegativity of the
oxygen atom. The electrons in the C═O bond are drawn nearer to the O atom, giving it a partial negative
charge, and leaving the C atom with a partial positive charge. This makes the carbonyl C atom open to
attack by a nucleophile, such as the cyanide ion, CN−.
Note that the actual negative charge on a cyanide ion is on the carbon atom, not the nitrogen atom.
Step 1:

The negatively charged intermediate formed in the first step in the mechanism is highly reactive and
quickly reacts with an aqueous H+ ion. The hydrogen ion could be from HCN, from dilute acid or from water
present in the reaction mixture. This forms the 2-hydroxynitrile product.
Step 2:

All aldehydes and ketones form ‘2-hydroxynitriles’ when they undergo nucleophilic addition. This is
because the OH (hydroxyl) group will always be on the adjacent carbon atom to the nitrile group.
However, starting with the aldehyde methanal, HCHO, the hydroxynitrile formed in its nucleophilic addition
with HCN would be called hydroxyethanenitrile. In this case there is no need to insert the ‘2’ at the start of
its name as the OH group could only possibly bond to the single carbon atom next to the nitrile group.

Question
4

Working with a partner, answer these questions together:
a

b

Name the organic product that would be formed in the nucleophilic addition of HCN to:
i

ethanal

ii

propanone.

Use diagrams and curly arrows to describe the mechanism of the reaction in part a i.

18.5 Testing for aldehydes and ketones
Testing for the carbonyl group
The reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is an example of a condensation
reaction. In a condensation reaction, two molecules join together and, in the process, eliminate a small
molecule, in this case water. The equation for the reaction of ethanal with 2,4-DNPH is:

Other classes of organic compound that also contain the carbonyl group, >C═O (such as carboxylic acids
and esters), do not form precipitates with 2,4-DNPH.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 18.3
Testing with 2,4-DNPH
We can easily test for the presence of a carbonyl group in an aldehyde or ketone by adding a solution
of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (often abbreviated to 2,4-DNPH). If an aldehyde or ketone is present, a
deep-orange precipitate is formed (Figure 18.3).
The structure of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is:

The precipitate formed can be purified by recrystallisation and its melting point can be measured
experimentally. The identity of the precipitated compound can then be found by referring to melting
point data. From this, we can identify the specific aldehyde or ketone used in the test.

Figure 18.3: The orange precipitate formed from 2,4-DNPH in a test with propanone, a ketone.

Distinguishing between aldehydes and ketones
As we saw in Section 18.2, aldehydes can be further oxidised to form carboxylic acids, but ketones cannot
be oxidised easily. We can use this difference to distinguish between an aldehyde and a ketone in simple
chemical tests. The two most common tests involve mild oxidation using Tollens’ reagent or Fehling’s
solution.

practiCAL ACTIVITY 18.4
Testing with Tollens’ reagent

Tollens’ reagent is an aqueous solution of silver nitrate in excess ammonia solution, sometimes called
ammoniacal silver nitrate solution. The silver ions, Ag+, in the solution act as a mild oxidising agent.
When warmed, the Ag+ ions will oxidise an aldehyde to form a carboxylate ion.
Under the alkaline conditions in the test, any carboxylic acid formed is immediately neutralised to the
carboxylate ion, ─COO−, as H+ is removed from ─COOH and a salt is formed.
In the redox reaction with an aldehyde, the Ag+ ions themselves are reduced to silver atoms. The
silver atoms form a ‘mirror’ on the inside of the tube, giving a positive test for an aldehyde (Figure
18.4).
There will be no change observed when a ketone is warmed with Tollens’ reagent as no redox reaction
takes place. It remains a colourless mixture in the test-tube.

Figure 18.4: The ‘before’ and ‘after’ observations when Tollens’ reagent is warmed with an aldehyde, such as
ethanal, CH3CHO.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 18.5
Testing with Fehling’s solution
Fehling’s solution is an alkaline solution containing copper(II) ions. When warmed with an aldehyde,
the Cu2+ ions act as an oxidising agent. The aldehyde is oxidised to a carboxylate ion while the Cu2+
ions are reduced to Cu+ ions. The clear blue Fehling’s solution turns an opaque red / orange colour as a
precipitate of copper(I) oxide forms throughout the solution (Figure 18.5).
As with Tollens’ reagent, ketones are not oxidised in this test, so there is no change. The Fehling’s
solution remains blue when warmed.

ethanal, CH3CHO.

18.6 Reactions to form tri-iodomethane
Tri-iodomethane (iodoform) forms as a yellow precipitate with methyl ketones, i.e. compounds containing
the CH3CO─ group (Figure 18.6). Note that ethanal, CH3CHO, an aldehyde, also contains the CH3CO─ group.
Chemists use the appearance of the yellow precipitate as evidence of the CH3CO─ group in an unknown
compound.
The reagent used is an alkaline solution of iodine, which is warmed together with the substance being
tested.

Figure 18.6: The yellow precipitate of tri-iodomethane forming.

The reaction involves two steps:
1 the carbonyl compound is halogenated: the three hydrogen atoms in the CH3 methyl group are replaced
by iodine atoms
2 the intermediate is hydrolysed to form the yellow precipitate of tri-iodomethane, CHI3 (Figure 18.6).
When separated from the reaction mixture, the yellow crystals of tri-iodomethane can be positively
identified by their melting point of 119 °C.
Here, R is an alkyl group in a methyl ketone:

Testing for the CH3CH(OH)─ group
The tri-iodomethane test can also be used to identify the presence of a secondary alcohol, with the hydroxy

group (─OH) on the carbon atom next to a methyl group. This CH3CH(OH)─ group is firstly oxidised by the
alkaline iodine solution. This oxidation forms a methyl ketone, RCOCH3, which then reacts via the two steps
shown at the bottom of the first column. The products of the reaction are the yellow tri-iodomethane
precipitate, CHI3, and the sodium salt of a carboxylic acid, RCOO−Na+.

18.7 Infrared spectroscopy
In infrared spectroscopy a sample being analysed is irradiated (exposed to radiation) with
electromagnetic waves in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine used is called
a spectrophotometer. It detects the intensity of the wavelengths of infrared radiation that passes through
the sample.
This analytical technique is particularly useful for organic chemists because all organic molecules absorb
radiation in the infrared range of wavelengths. The energy absorbed corresponds to changes in the
vibration of the bonds between atoms. The bonds can vibrate by stretching, bending and twisting. They
have a natural frequency at which they vibrate. If we irradiate the molecules with energy that corresponds
to this frequency, it stimulates larger vibrations and energy is absorbed. This is called the resonance
frequency of that vibration.
Each type of vibration will absorb characteristic wavelengths of infrared radiation. Scientists often express
these as the reciprocal of the wavelength, in a unit called wavenumbers (measured in cm−1).

Figure 18.7: The infrared spectrum of ethylamine, CH3CH2NH2. Note that the percentage absorbance and the
wavenumbers on the axes both get smaller in magnitude along each axis.

We cannot be too specific when quoting the characteristic absorption frequency of a bond: the nature of
the rest of the molecule shifts the energy absorbed in each particular molecule. However, we can say, for
example, that the amine group (─NH2) absorbs in the range 3300 to 3500 cm−1.
Therefore, we can identify the presence (or absence) of different functional groups from the absorbance
pattern on an infrared spectrum. Look at the infrared spectrum of ethylamine in Figure 18.7.
We can use the characteristic infrared spectrum of an unknown compound to identify it by ‘fingerprinting’
from a database of known spectra. Some characteristic absorption ranges of common bonds and the
functional groups containing the bonds are shown in Table 18.3.

Table 18.3: Some characteristic infrared absorbance bands.

The values needed to answer questions will usually be given to you. You can see that absorption bands
overlap considerably. That is why we need to use a variety of techniques, such as NMR, infrared
spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, to work out the structure of a new organic compound (see Chapter
29).
As well as their wavenumber bands, particular absorbances have characteristic widths (broad or sharp
peaks) and intensities (strong or weak) on the infrared spectrum. For example, the presence of hydrogen
bonding makes the absorbance of the O─H bonds in alcohols and carboxylic acids broad. By contrast, the
C═O bond in carbonyl groups has a strong, sharp absorbance peak.
Look at the infrared spectra of ethanol, ethanoic acid and ethyl ethanoate shown in Figures 18.8–18.10.
Using the data in Table 18.3, note the broad bands between 3200 and 3600 cm−1 in Figures 18.8 and 18.9
arising from the O─H groups involved in hydrogen bonding in the alcohol and in the carboxylic acid.
Contrast the width of these peaks with the sharp peak between 1710 and 1750 cm−1 of the carbonyl group
in the ester, ethyl ethanoate, in Figure 18.10.

SUMMARY
Aldehydes and ketones contain the carbonyl group, >C═O:
in aldehydes, the carbonyl group is bonded to one other carbon atom and a hydrogen atom
in ketones, the carbonyl group is bonded to two other carbon atoms.
The names of aldehydes are derived from the name of the alkane with the ‘-e’ at the end replaced by ‘-al’.
Similarly, ketones are named with the ‘-e’ replaced by ‘-one’.
Carbonyl compounds are readily reduced by aqueous NaBH4 or LiAlH4 dissolved in dry ether:
reduction of an aldehyde forms a primary alcohol
reduction of a ketone produces a secondary alcohol.
Aldehydes are readily oxidised under mild conditions to carboxylic acids. Ketones are not oxidised under mild
conditions.
The polar nature of the carbonyl group in aldehydes and ketones enables them to undergo nucleophilic addition by
reacting with the cyanide ions (CN−) from HCN. The product is a 2-hydroxynitrile.
The reagent 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) can be used to identify the presence of a carbonyl group in an
aldehyde or ketone. It produces an orange precipitate. The melting point of the product is used to identify particular
aldehydes and ketones.
As aldehydes are readily oxidised, they may be distinguished from ketones on warming with suitably mild oxidising
reagents:
with aldehydes, Tollens’ reagent produces a silver mirror inside a warmed test-tube and Fehling’s solution turns
from a blue solution to a red / orange precipitate when warmed
with ketones, there is no oxidation reaction, so no changes are observed when ketones are warmed with Tollens’
reagent or Fehling’s solution.
Chemists can use alkaline iodine solution to test for:
methyl ketones (and ethanal)
ethanol or secondary alcohols with an adjacent methyl group.
A yellow precipitate of tri-iodomethane is formed in a positive test.
Infrared spectroscopy helps to identify organic compounds by their absorption of energy in the infrared range of
wavelengths, matching their spectrum to a database of known infrared spectra.

Practical skills 1

P1.1 Introduction
The analytical skills of chemists are still important despite the development of new increasingly rapid and
sensitive instrumental techniques (Figure P1.1) (see Chapter 30). Your practical skills make an important
contribution to the grade you achieve in your chemistry qualification.

Figure P1.1: Chemist performing a titration.

Review of practical knowledge and understanding
In scientific investigations, we are often interested in finding out how one variable affects another. For
example, we might want to investigate a precipitation reaction to find out how the concentration of a
reactant affects the rate at which the precipitate forms. You might have seen the reaction between sodium
thiosulfate and dilute hydrochloric acid, which is a commonly investigated precipitation reaction. Sulfur is
the precipitate formed:
Na2S2O3(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + S(s) + H2O(l) + SO2(g)
This type of investigation involves changing only the variable under investigation (in this case the
concentration of a reactant) and keeping all other relevant variables constant. We can judge the effect of
changing the concentration by devising a way to measure how quickly the precipitate forms, such as timing
how long it takes for the solution to become opaque.
We now have the question we are investigating and the structure of the investigation in terms of its key
variables:
In a precipitation reaction, how does the concentration of a reactant affect the rate of precipitation (as
measured by the time it takes for the solution to become opaque)?
The independent variable is the one under investigation. This is changed systematically and we can
choose different values (in this case, the concentration of reactant).
The dependent variable is the one we measure to judge the effect of changing the independent
variable (in this case, the time it takes for the solution to become opaque).
The control variables are those that we must keep constant to ensure a fair test is carried out (in this
case, we should control the temperature and total volume of reactants used).
Note that we can express the question in this type of investigation generally as:
How does the independent variable affect the dependent variable?
When asked to plan and / or carry out an investigation, it is important that you state the question under
investigation clearly. You also need to list the independent, dependent and control variables before you
start writing down your proposed method or planning how to record and present your results.
The type of variable under investigation will determine whether you display the data collected in a table, as
a line graph or as a bar chart.

To decide which type of graph to draw, you need to know the difference between numerical value within
the range of results – and categoric continuous variables – which are described using words. We can
assume that the dependent variable is continuous, as it measures the effect of varying the independent
variable. Then if the independent variable is continuous, we draw a line graph. If the independent variable
is categoric, we draw a bar chart. So if you investigate the effect of temperature on rate of reaction, the
data can be presented as a line graph. If you investigate the rate of different metals reacting with dilute
acid, the data can be presented as a bar chart (as there are no values between those chosen for the
independent variable). See the graphs in Figure P1.2.

Figure P1.2: A continuous independent variable → a line graph; a categoric independent variable → a bar chart.

When sitting a Practical Skills examination, you will need to follow instructions to carry out an investigation
into an unknown substance or mixture of substances. Always read through all of the instructions before
carrying out the tests. Testing for unknown substances will require you to describe your observations in
detail. You will be able to refer to tables of tests for cations, anions and gases (see Appendix 3) to draw
your conclusions.
You will also carry out a quantitative task (based on measurements) as well as a qualitative task (based on
observations). Examples of problems that need you to collect quantitative data could be a titration (a
volumetric analysis) or an enthalpy change experiment.
The quantitative task will require you to read scales on measuring instruments such as burettes, measuring
cylinders, gas syringes and balances. For instruments with an analogue scale, such as a burette, you
should be able to read measurements to within half the value of the fine line divisions on the scale. So a
burette with fine line divisions every 0.10 cm3 should be read to the nearest 0.05 cm3. A thermometer with
fine line divisions every 1 °C should be read to the nearest 0.5 °C (see Figure P1.3).
However, if a measuring instrument has very fine calibration (tightly grouped marks), it should be read to
the nearest calibrated mark.
Useful definitions to know, because you may need to decide upon or recognise these in a task, are:
Range: the minimum and maximum values for the independent or the dependent variable. For
example, in the rate of precipitation investigation, the range of the independent variable (the
concentration) might be 0.2 mol dm−3 to 1.0 mol dm−3.
Interval: the difference chosen between consecutive values of the independent variable. For example,
in the rate of precipitation investigation you might choose to test concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8
and 1.0 mol dm−3, giving an interval of 0.2 mol dm−3.
Anomalous result: a result that does not follow an established pattern.
Precise results: results in which each set of repeat readings are grouped closely together.
Accurate results: results that reflect the true value of a quantity.

P1.2 Manipulation, measurement and observation
In order to address a Practical Skills examination, you will need to master the expectations set out
throughout this chapter.

Expectations
Successful collection of data and observations
You should be able to:
set up apparatus correctly
follow instructions given in the form of written instructions or diagrams
use the apparatus to collect an appropriate quantity of data or observations, including subtle
differences in colour, solubility or quantity of materials
make measurements using pipettes, burettes, measuring cylinders, thermometers and other common
laboratory apparatus.

Quality of measurements or observations
You should be able to:
make accurate and consistent measurements and observations.

Decisions relating to measurements or observations
You should be able to:
decide how many tests or observations to perform
make measurements that span a range and have a distribution appropriate to the experiment
decide how long to leave experiments running before making readings
identify where repeated readings or observations are appropriate
replicate readings or observations as necessary
identify where confirmatory tests are appropriate and the nature of such tests
choose reagents to distinguish between given ions.
Points to remember
When describing a liquid or solution that is not coloured and is transparent, always use the word
‘colourless’. Some people make the mistake of just writing ‘clear’ – but a solution of copper(II) sulfate is
clear (i.e. transparent) but blue in colour.
A solution that appears white and opaque in a chemical test probably contains a fine suspension of a
white precipitate: for example, when using lime water to test for carbon dioxide gas.
When carrying out a titration, you should repeat the test until you have two titres that are within 0.1
cm3 of each other. Ideally you should be aiming for two concordant titres with the same values – but
judging the end-point can be tricky. That is why we carry out repeat sets of each test in many
investigations – to make our results more accurate by reducing experimental error. You can read more
about sources of error in Section P1.4.
In a titration, the first titre measured is always a rough value to establish approximately where the
actual end-point lies. When obtaining subsequent values, you should be able to add the solution from
the burette one drop at a time near the end-point.
Sometimes a result is clearly incorrect. For example, it might be very different from the others in a
repeat set of readings or does not follow a well-established pattern in a series of tests. If you have
time, try it again. If not, discard it: do not include it in your calculation of the mean; ignore the
anomalous point when drawing a line of best fit on a graph.
When plotting a line graph of the data collected, a minimum of five values of the independent variable

(which is plotted along the horizontal axis) must be recorded to be confident of any pattern observed.
Note that it is possible to have precise results that are not particularly accurate. For example, if you
measure the mass of a product formed three times and the results are all the same, they are precise.
However, if the balance was not set to zero for any of the measurements, the mass will not be
accurate.

Question
2

a

A learner carried out a titration four times and got results for the titre of 13.25, 12.95, 12.65 and
then 12.65 cm3. What is the most accurate value of the titre to use in any calculations?

b

What do we call a mixture of water and fine particles of an insoluble solid dispersed throughout
the liquid?

c

Describe any similarities and differences you observe when looking at a test-tube of dilute sulfuric
acid and a test-tube of 0.05 mol dm−3 copper(II) sulfate solution.

d

Name the white precipitate formed in the test for carbon dioxide gas.

In Question 1 in Section P1.1, name a piece of apparatus the learner could use to measure:
i

the independent variable

ii

the dependent variable.

P1.3 Presentation of data and observations

draw up the table in advance of taking readings or making observations so that you do not have to
copy up your results
include in the table of results, if necessary, columns for raw data, for calculated values and for
analyses or conclusions
use column headings that include both the quantity and the unit and that conform to accepted
scientific conventions

You should be able to:
choose a suitable and clear method to present the data, e.g. tables, graphs or a mixture of
presentation methods
select which variables to plot and decide whether a graph should be drawn as a straight line or a curve
plot appropriate variables on clearly labelled x- and y-axes
choose sensible scales for graph axes
plot all points or bars to an appropriate accuracy
follow the Association for Science Education (ASE) recommendations for putting lines on graphs (see
the ‘Points to remember’ referring to graphs, below).
Points to remember
There are certain conventions to observe when designing and drawing a table to use to record your
experimental data. Generally, the independent variable goes in the first column and the dependent
variable goes in the second column. Sometimes, if space on the page is an issue, a table can be
organised horizontally. In this case, the independent variable again goes first but at the start of the
first row in the table, with the dependent variable beneath it, not next to it as in a conventional table.
When recording quantitative data you will often need columns for repeat results and calculations of the
mean. This is achieved by subdividing the column for the dependent variable into the required number
of columns. For example, in the rate of precipitation investigation described at the beginning of this
chapter, the table to record three repeat readings and their means would be organised as:
Time for reaction mixture to turn opaque / s
Concentration / mol dm−3

1st test

2nd test

3rd test

Mean

Note that the headings in the table have their units included. You then do not need to record the units
for each entry you make in the table.
On graphs, always plot the independent variable along the horizontal (x-)axis and the dependent
variable up the vertical (y-)axis.

Draw the lines in tables and graphs in pencil, labelling the axes as in the corresponding table headings,
including their units.
In the table above, there could be an extra column on the right-hand side for values of the reciprocal of
the mean time taken for the reaction mixture to become opaque (headed ‘
on a graph of

’). This could be plotted

against concentration to see how the rate of reaction varies with temperature (as

rate is proportional to

, so the greater the time, the slower the rate). See the graphs in Figure

P1.4.

Figure P1.4: Graphs that could be drawn from the data in a table using concentrations and mean times.

The labelled axes must be longer than half the size of the graph grid in both directions, selecting a
sensible scale (e.g. 1, 2, 5 or 10 units per 20 mm square on the grid: not 3 units).
Each point should be plotted as a small, neat x or + with a sharp pencil. The line drawn through the
points should not be ‘dot-to-dot’ but should be a line of best fit. This should be either drawn with a
ruler for a straight line or a smooth free-hand line for a curve. Think of the best-fit line as the ‘average’
line though the points.
Always show your working out in calculations.
Only give answers produced by calculation to correspond to the number of significant figures of the
least accurate experimental data used. So, if calculating a concentration using titre volumes such as
15.35 cm3, then the value of the concentration of the unknown solution can be given to 4 significant
figures (e.g. 1.244 or 0.9887 mol dm−3). However, if the known concentration of one of the reactants is
given to three significant figures (e.g. 0.0250 mol dm−3 or 0.200 mol dm−3), then the calculated
concentration could be given to three significant figures.
When recording qualitative descriptions in a table, if there is ‘no change visible’, write that and do not
just put in a dash.

P1.4 Analysis, conclusions and evaluation
Expectations
Interpretation of data or observations and identifying sources of error
You should be able to:
describe the patterns and trends shown by tables and graphs
describe and summarise the key points of a set of observations
find an unknown value by using co-ordinates or intercepts on a graph
calculate other quantities from data, or calculate the mean from replicate (repeat) values, or make
other appropriate calculations
determine the gradient of a straight-line graph
evaluate the effectiveness of control variables
identify the most significant sources of error in an experiment
estimate, quantitatively, the uncertainty in quantitative measurements
express such uncertainty in a measurement as an actual or percentage error
show an understanding of the distinction between systematic errors and random errors.

Drawing conclusions
You should be able to:
draw conclusions from an experiment, giving an outline description of the main features of the data,
considering whether experimental data support a given hypothesis, and making further predictions
draw conclusions from interpretations of observations, data and calculated values
make scientific explanations of the data, observations and conclusions that have been described.

Suggesting improvements
You should be able to:
suggest modifications to an experimental arrangement that will improve the accuracy of the
experiment or the accuracy of the observations that can be made
suggest ways in which to extend the investigation to answer a new question
describe such modifications clearly in words or diagrams.
Points to remember
To measure the gradient (slope) of a straight line on a graph, choose two points on the line at least half
as far apart as its total length. Then construct a right-angled triangle, as shown in Figure P1.5. The
gradient tells us the rate of change of y (the dependent variable) per unit change of x (the
independent variable):
gradient =

Figure P1.5: Finding the gradient of a straight-line graph. Choosing to construct a large triangle reduces the percentage
error in the values read from the axes, which are then used to calculate the gradient.

When evaluating the quality of the data collected, there are two types of error to consider: random
errors and systematic errors. Whenever we carry out an experiment, there are always errors involved.
They might be due to the person carrying out the experiment not reading the scale on a measuring
instrument correctly or choosing a measuring instrument with an inappropriate scale. These examples
of human error are equally likely to make the values of data too high or too low, so they are called
random errors. Repeating tests and taking the mean value helps to reduce the effect of random
errors.
However, other errors can result in consistently high or low values being recorded. These are called
systematic errors. Examples would be reading the volume of liquid in a burette to the upper level of
the liquid instead of to the bottom of the meniscus. It should be noted though that these consistently
high measurements of volume would not result in an incorrect value for the titre, because the final
volume is subtracted from the initial volume. Not ensuring the measuring instrument is correctly set on
zero is another example of a systematic error. If this is not corrected during an investigation, it can
result in consistently high or low masses being measured on balances. Other systematic errors can be
caused by errors when planning an investigation. This might result in data being collected that does
not really answer the question under investigation. For example, a control variable might not be kept
constant or taken into account, or the dependent variable chosen might not be a true measure of the
effect of varying the independent variable. An error such as this will make the data collected invalid
(incorrect).
You will have to estimate the error that is found in reading scales, as described at the beginning of this
chapter. In your evaluation of the experiment you should discuss the effect that these measurement
errors might have on the validity of the data and the conclusions you can draw from them. In the
example of a thermometer with 1 °C calibration marks, you can quote values to the nearest 0.5 °C.
The actual effect of this margin of error on confidence levels will depend on the magnitude of the
temperature being measured. When reading a low temperature of, say, 5.0 °C, plus or minus 0.5 °C
will have a bigger effect than when reading a higher temperature, such as 92.5 °C. For this reason it is
best to quote percentage errors, worked out using the equation:
percentage error =

× 100%

In enthalpy change investigations, you often have to measure temperature differences. You can do this
by subtracting the final temperature from the initial temperature. In this case, using the thermometer
just described, the error would be plus or minus 1 °C, as the two 0.5 °C margins of error in both
readings should be added together. In this case, you should suggest increasing the temperature
change. For example, when evaluating enthalpies of combustion of alcohols by heating water in a
copper calorimeter, you could use a smaller volume of water to heat. However, this change would have
to be balanced against the increase in percentage error in measuring the smaller volume of water, to
see which gives the least percentage error overall.
You might need to suggest how to make your data from an experiment more accurate. For example, in
the rate of precipitation investigation, you could improve the accuracy of judging the time for the
reaction to reach a certain point in each test carried out. Whereas judging the moment when a pencil

mark can no longer be seen through the reaction mixture is subjective, you could use a light source
and light meter to make more objective judgements. You could stop the timer when the level of light
passing through the reaction mixture drops to the same level as measured by the light meter in each
test. This will make your repeat (or replicate) data more precise and improve the accuracy of your
results.
Your evaluation might lead beyond suggestions to change the method to ideas to investigate new
questions. For example, when evaluating the rate of precipitation, you will have tried to control the
temperature: probably by ensuring that both the solutions mixed started at the same temperature.
However, if the reaction is exothermic, this might cause the temperature to change between the
different concentrations investigated. This could lead to a new investigation to compare the energy
transferred in a precipitation reaction at different concentrations. The question could be phrased as
‘How does the concentration of a reactant solution affect the … energy transferred in the reaction?’.
When drawing conclusions from investigations involving the manipulation of variables, you should refer
to your graph when commenting on the relationship between the independent and dependent
variables. You can explain your findings using the data and your scientific knowledge and
understanding.
When drawing conclusions from qualitative tests to identify an unknown substance, where possible, try
to carry out or suggest a further confirmatory test for the same substance (see Appendix 3).
Any hypotheses you test can only be refuted (disproved) by a practical investigation you carry out.
They cannot be proved because of the limitations of your investigation. So hypotheses can only be
‘supported’ by the data collected. Say that your hypothesis predicts that the rate of reaction increases
with increasing concentration, with a justification using collision theory, and then show how data
collected from your investigation supports this. You cannot say whether this relationship is true beyond
the range of concentrations tested. There might be a point using higher concentrations where
increasing the concentration of one reactant will start to have less, or even no, effect on the rate. This
could be because there is such an excess of one reactant that the rate of collisions with the other
reactant particles is not affected by further increases of concentration. This would now give you
another idea to test!

WORKED EXAMPLES
1

What is the percentage error in the case of the two temperatures 5 °C and 92.5 °C?

Solution
For the reading of 5 °C the percentage error will be:
= 10%
whereas for 92.5 °C the percentage error is:
= 0.54%
So there is a significant error in reading 5 °C compared with reading 92.5 °C.

INVESTIGATING THE STRUCTURE OF CRYSTALS
When water waves hit a barrier with a narrow slit in the middle of it, the waves behind the slit appear
to be curved. We say that the waves have been diffracted. The electrons in a crystal lattice can act like
a slit and X-rays can be diffracted by the crystal.

Figure 19.1: The X-ray diffraction pattern appears as a series of spots. We can determine the structure of a crystal
from the position of the spots.

When a beam of X-rays of one particular wavelength falls on a crystal, some X-rays pass straight
through the crystal but others are absorbed. The absorbed X-rays cause some electrons to become
‘excited’ and move to higher energy levels. When these electrons return to a lower energy level X-rays
are re-emitted (‘reflected’ again). These re-emitted X-rays are scattered in an orderly manner. The
scattered X-rays give rise to an interference pattern of spots which are recorded on a photographic
plate (Figure 19.1). The X-ray diffraction pattern is related to the pattern of the electrons in the solid
and the density of the electrons. A mathematical analysis of the X-ray pattern was first carried out by
William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg (Figure 19.2). From this analysis they were able to
deduce the pattern of electron density in the solid and hence identify the relative positions of the
electrons and atoms. These maps are similar to geographical contour maps (maps showing similar
heights joined by curved lines). From these maps it is possible to construct an accurate model of the
solid. Bond lengths can be determined to an accuracy of better than 1%.

Figure 19.2: William Henry Bragg developed X-ray diffraction to determine the structures of simple crystals. Dorothy
Hodgkin developed the method further to determine the structure of penicillin and insulin.

The calculations involved in translating the diffraction pattern into a model of the crystal structure are
extremely complicated. To determine even a simple structure such as sodium chloride requires a lot of
mathematical knowledge and many complex calculations.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Suggest why the position of H atoms in compounds is not usually determined by X-ray diffraction.
The first crystal structure to be determined by X-ray crystallography was zinc sulfide. This was
done over 100 years ago. The crystal structures of some proteins and DNA were determined 50
years later than this. Suggest why it took so much longer to determine the crystal structures of
proteins and DNA.

19.1 Defining lattice energy
When ions combine to form an ionic solid, there is a huge release of energy. The reaction is highly
exothermic. The energy given out when ions of opposite charges come together to form a crystalline lattice
⦵
is called the lattice energy, ΔHlatt
.
Lattice energy is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of an ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions
under standard conditions.
You can see equations describing the lattice energy of sodium chloride and magnesium chloride here.
Na+(g) + Cl−(g) → NaCl(s)
Mg2+(g) + 2Cl−(g) → MgCl2(s)

⦵
ΔHlatt
= −787 kJ mol−1

⦵
ΔHlatt
= −2526 kJ mol−1

Note that:
it is the gaseous ions that combine to form the ionic solid

⦵
the lattice energy is always exothermic: the value of ΔHlatt
is always negative, because the definition
specifies the bonding together of ions, not the separation of ions.

The large exothermic value of the lattice energy shows that the ionic lattice is very stable with respect to
its gaseous ions. The more exothermic the lattice energy, the stronger the ionic bonding in the lattice.
It is impossible to determine the lattice energy of a compound by a single direct experiment. We can,
⦵
however, calculate a value for ΔHlatt
using several experimental values and an energy cycle called a Born–
Haber cycle. To do this, we first need to introduce two more types of enthalpy change.
Note that the quantity we have defined as lattice energy is more accurately called the lattice enthalpy.
However, the term ‘lattice energy’ is commonly applied to lattice enthalpy as well. Lattice energy is the
internal energy change when 1 mole of an ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions at 298 K. Lattice
enthalpy values are very close to the corresponding lattice energy values.

IMPORTANT
Remember that the enthalpy change for lattice energy ΔHlatt is always negative.

Question

a

Give values for the standard conditions of temperature and pressure.

b

Write equations describing the lattice energy of:
i

magnesium oxide

ii

potassium bromide

iii

sodium sulfide.

19.2 Enthalpy change of atomisation and electron
affinity
Enthalpy change of atomisation
The standard enthalpy change of atomisation of lithium relates to the equation:
Li(s) → Li(g)

⦵
ΔHat
= +161 kJ mol−1

The standard enthalpy change of atomisation of chlorine relates to the equation:
Cl2(g) → Cl(g)

⦵
ΔHat
= +122 kJ mol−1

⦵
Values of ΔHat
are always positive (endothermic). This is because energy must be supplied to break the
bonds holding the atoms in the element together.

Question
2

a

The bond energy of the chlorine molecule is +244 kJ mol−1. Why is the standard enthalpy change
of atomisation half this value?

b

Write equations, including state symbols, that represent the enthalpy change of atomisation of:

c

i

oxygen

ii

barium

iii

bromine.

What is the numerical value of the enthalpy change of atomisation of helium? Explain your
answer.

Electron affinity
The energy change occurring when a gaseous non-metal atom accepts one electron is called the electron
affinity. The symbol for electron affinity is EA.
The first electron affinity, EA1, is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of
gaseous atoms to form 1 mole of gaseous ions with a single negative charge under standard conditions.
Equations representing the first electron affinity of chlorine and sulfur are:
Cl(g) + e− → Cl−(g)
S(g) + e− → S−(g)

EA1 = −348 kJ mol−1
EA1 = −200 kJ mol−1

Note that:
the change is from gaseous atoms to gaseous 1− ions
the enthalpy change for the first electron affinity, EA1 is generally exothermic: EA1 is negative.
When an element forms an ion with more than one negative charge, we must use successive electron
affinities (this is rather like the successive ionisation energies we used in Section 2.2). The first, second and
third electron affinities have symbols EA1, EA2 and EA3.
The equations representing the first and second electron affinities of oxygen are:
first electron affinity:
O(g) + e− → O−(g)

EA1 = −141 kJ mol−1

second electron affinity:
O−(g) + e− → O2−(g)

EA2 = +798 kJ mol−1

Note that second electron affinities are always endothermic (EA2 is positive), and so are third electron
affinities.
The overall enthalpy change in forming an oxide ion, O2−, from an oxygen atom is found by adding
together the first and second electron affinities:
O(g) + 2e− → O2−(g)

EA1 + EA2
= (−141) + (+798)
= +657 kJ mol−1

Trends in electron affinities
There is less experimental data about electron affinities compared with ionisation energies. For some
atoms the variation in the experimental data is considerable. Generally, electron affinities for non-metal
atoms get more negative (more exothermic) across a period with a maximum at Group 17 but the pattern
is not always clear. There is no clear pattern in electron affinities down many groups apart from Groups 16
and 17. Table 19.1 shows that here, there is a trend to less negative (less exothermic) electron affinities as
you go down the group, apart from the first member in the group.
Electron affinity / kJ mol−1
C = −122.3

N = 0 (±19)

O = −141.1

F = −328.0

S = −200.4

Cl = −348.8

Se = −195

Br = −324.6

Te = −190

I = −295.4

Table 19.1: Selected electron affinities.

The value of the first electron affinity depends on the attraction between the added electron and the
positively charged nucleus. The stronger the attraction, the greater the amount of energy released. These
factors influencing the value of the electron affinity for Group 16 and 17 elements are the same as those
relating to first ionisation energy:
The greater the nuclear charge, the greater the attractive force between the nucleus and the outer
electrons. So chlorine, with a greater nuclear charge than sulfur, will tend to attract an electron more
readily. This means that more energy is released when a chlorine atom gains an electron.
The further away the outer shell electrons are from the positive nuclear charge, the less the attractive
force between the nucleus and the outer shell electrons is. Since the number of electron shells (and
the atomic radius) increases down Groups 16 and 17, the electron affinity decreases going from
chlorine to bromine to iodine.
The greater the number of electron shells, the greater the power of inner shell electrons to shield the
outer shell electrons from the nuclear charge. This also helps to decrease the electron affinity as you
go from chlorine to iodine.

IMPORTANT
Fluorine does not fit the trend. The electron affinity of a fluorine atom is lower than that of a chlorine
atom because the atomic radius of the fluorine atom is very small. The high electron density causes a
greater repulsion between the electrons within the atom. This greatly reduces the attractive effect
between the incoming electron and the nucleus.

Question
3

a

Suggest why the second and third electron affinities are always endothermic.

b

The first electron affinity of sulfur is −200 kJ mol−1. The second electron affinity of sulfur is +640
kJ mol−1. Calculate a value for the enthalpy change
S(g) + 2e− → S2−(g)

c

Write equations representing:

d

i

the first electron affinity of iodine

ii

the second electron affinity of sulfur.

Explain the trend in the first electron affinities going from sulfur to tellurium.

19.3 Born–Haber cycles
Components of the Born–Haber cycle
We have seen how we can apply Hess’s law in energy cycles to work out enthalpy changes (Section 6.4). A
Born–Haber cycle is a particular type of energy cycle used to calculate lattice energy. In simple terms it can
be represented by Figure 19.3.

Figure 19.3: A simple energy cycle that can be used to calculate lattice energy. The dashed line shows the two-step
⦵
route: using Hess’s law, ΔH1⦵ + ΔHlatt
= ΔHf⦵

We can determine the lattice energy of a compound if we know:
its enthalpy change of formation, ΔHf⦵

the enthalpy changes involved in changing the elements from their standard states to their gaseous
ions, ΔH1⦵ .
According to Hess’s law, Figure 19.3 shows that:

ΔH1⦵ + ΔHlatt
= ΔHf⦵

Rearranging this equation we get:
⦵
ΔHlatt
= ΔHf⦵ − ΔH1⦵

IMPORTANT
When constructing Born–Haber cycles, remember:
1 atomise metal →
ionise metal →
atomise non-metal →
ionise non-metal →
2 for ionising metals you use ionisation energies and for ionising non-metals you use electron
affinities.
The enthalpy change ΔH1⦵ involves several steps.
Taking lithium fluoride as an example, the relevant enthalpy cycle can be written to show these steps
(Figure 19.4).

Figure 19.4: An energy cycle that can be used to calculate the lattice energy of lithium fluoride. The dashed line shows
the two-step route.

The enthalpy changes needed to calculate ΔH1⦵ are as follows.
Step 1: Convert solid lithium to gaseous lithium atoms: the enthalpy change required is the enthalpy
⦵
change of atomisation of lithium, ΔHat
.
Li(s) → Li(g)

⦵
ΔHat
= +161 kJ mol−1

Step 2: Convert gaseous lithium atoms to gaseous lithium ions: the enthalpy change required is the first
ionisation energy of lithium, IE1 (see Section 2.2).
Li(s) → Li(g) + e−

IE1 = +520 kJ mol−1

Step 3: Convert fluorine molecules to fluorine atoms: the enthalpy change required is the enthalpy change
⦵
of atomisation of fluorine, ΔHat
.
F2(g) → F(g)

⦵
ΔHat
= +79 kJ mol−1

Step 4: Convert gaseous fluorine atoms to gaseous fluoride ions: the enthalpy change required is the first
electron affinity of fluorine, EA1.
F(g) + e− → F−(g)

EA1 = −328 kJ mol−1

Step 5: By adding all these values together, we get a value for ΔH1⦵ . We can then calculate the lattice
energy using Hess’s law.
The enthalpy change of formation of lithium fluoride is −617 kJ mol−1.
We now have all the information we need to calculate the lattice energy.

Calculating lattice energies
Applying Hess’s law to find the lattice energy of lithium fluoride:
⦵
ΔHlatt
= ΔHf⦵ − ΔH1⦵

We know that:

⦵
⦵
ΔH1⦵ = ΔHat
[Li] + IE1 [Li] + ΔHat
[F] + EA1 [F]

Putting in the figures:

ΔH1⦵ = (+161) + (+520) + (+79) + (−328) = +432
⦵
ΔHlatt
= (−617) − (+432) = −1049 kJ mol−1

Note: take care to account for the signs of the enthalpy changes. The values of the enthalpy changes of
formation and the overall electron affinity may be negative or positive.

The Born–Haber cycle as an energy level diagram
We can show the Born–Haber cycle as an energy level diagram (Figure 19.5). This is the best, and clearest,
type of diagram for a Born–Haber cycle. You should therefore choose to draw this type of diagram to show
a Born–Haber cycle.

Figure 19.5: Born–Haber cycle for lithium fluoride.

To draw the cycle, you:
start by putting down the elements in their standard state on the left-hand side
add the other enthalpy changes in the order of steps 1 to 4 shown in Figure 19.5
complete the cycle by adding the enthalpy change of formation and lattice energy.

Note: the arrows going upwards represent an increase in energy (ΔH⦵ is positive) and the arrows going
downwards represent a decrease in energy (ΔH⦵ is negative).

IMPORTANT
When constructing Born–Haber cycles, remember that the elements go near the bottom on the lefthand side and you atomise and ionise the metal first then atomise and ionise the non-metal.

The Born–Haber cycle for magnesium chloride
The Born–Haber cycle for magnesium chloride is shown in Figure 19.6.

Figure 19.6: Born–Haber cycle for magnesium chloride.

There are a few differences between this cycle and the one for lithium fluoride.
1 The magnesium ion is Mg2+, so the first and the second ionisation energies need to be taken into
account:
Mg(g) → Mg+(g) + e−
Mg+(g) → Mg2+(g) + e−

IE1 = +736 kJ mol−1
IE2 = +1450 kJ mol−1

2 There are two chloride ions in MgCl2, so the values of the enthalpy change of atomisation and the first
electron affinity of chlorine must be multiplied by 2.
Cl2(g) → 2Cl(g)
2Cl(g) + 2e− → 2Cl−(g)

⦵
2ΔHat
= 2 × (+122)
= +244 kJ mol−1
2EA1 = 2 × (−348)
= −696 kJ mol−1

In order to calculate the lattice energy, we need some additional information:
ΔHf⦵ [MgCl2] = −641 kJ mol−1
⦵
ΔHat
[Mg] = +148 kJ mol−1

According to Hess’s law:

⦵

Factors affecting the value of lattice energy
Lattice energy arises from the electrostatic force of attraction of oppositely charged ions when the
crystalline lattice is formed. The size and charge of these ions can affect the value of the lattice energy.

Lattice energy and ion size
As the size of the ion increases, the lattice energy becomes less exothermic. This applies to both anions
and cations. Figure 19.7 shows that:
for any given anion, e.g. F−, the lattice energy gets less exothermic as the size of the cation increases
from Li+ to Cs+

Figure 19.7: Lattice energies of the Group 1 halides.

for any given cation, e.g. Li+, the lattice energy gets less exothermic as the size of the anion increases
from F− to I−.
Ions with the same ionic charge have a lower charge density if their radius is larger. This is because the
same charge is spread out over a larger volume. A lower charge density results in weaker electrostatic
forces of attraction in the ionic lattice. Sodium fluoride has a less exothermic lattice energy than lithium
fluoride. This reflects the lower charge density on sodium ions compared with lithium ions.

Lattice energy and the charge on ions
The lattice energy becomes more exothermic as the ionic charge increases.
We can see this by comparing lithium fluoride, LiF, with magnesium oxide, MgO. These compounds have
the same arrangement of ions in their lattice structure. The cations Li+ and Mg2+ have similar sizes. The
anions F− and O2− are fairly similar in size (although they are much larger than the cations). The major
physical difference between LiF and MgO is the ionic charge. This affects the lattice energy:
⦵
ΔHlatt
[LiF] = −1049 kJ mol−1

⦵
ΔHlatt
[MgO] = −3923 kJ mol−1

Magnesium oxide has a greater lattice energy than lithium fluoride. The doubly charged Mg2+ and O2− ions
in magnesium oxide attract each other more strongly than the singly charged ions of the same size in LiF.
For ions of similar size, the greater the ionic charge, the higher the charge density. This results in stronger
ionic bonds being formed.

IMPORTANT
The value of the lattice energy depends on the size of the ions and the charge on the ion. The lattice
energy is higher if the ionic charge is greater and the ionic radius is smaller.

Ion polarisation
In our model of an ionic lattice, we have thought of the ions as being spherical in shape. This is not always
the case. In some cases, the positive charge on the cation in an ionic lattice may attract the electrons in
the anion towards it. This results in a distortion of the electron cloud of the anion and the anion is no longer
spherical (Figure 19.8). We call this distortion ion polarisation. The ability of a cation to attract electrons
and distort an anion is called the polarising power of the cation.

Figure 19.8: Ion polarisation. A small highly charged cation can distort the shape of the anion.

Factors affecting ion polarisation
The degree of polarisation of an anion depends on:
the charge density of the cation
the ease with which the anion can be polarised: its polarisability.
An anion is more likely to be polarised if:
the cation is small
the cation has a charge of 2+ or 3+
the anion is large
the anion has a charge of 2− or 3−.
A small highly charged cation such as Fe3+ can attract electrons and distort a larger anion to such an
extent that the bond formed has a considerable amount of covalent character. Pure ionic bonding and pure

covalent bonding are extremes. Many ionic compounds have some covalent character due to ion
polarisation. Many covalent compounds have some degree of charge separation, i.e. they are polar, due to
bond polarisation (see Chapter 4).

The thermal stability of Group 2 carbonates and nitrates

carbonates.

Table 19.2: Enthalpy change of reaction values for the decomposition of some Group 2 carbonates.

The relative ease of thermal decomposition is shown by the values of the enthalpy changes of reaction.
The more positive the enthalpy change, the more stable the carbonate relative to its oxide and carbon
dioxide. You can also see this in the decomposition temperatures: the further down the group, the higher
the temperature required to decompose the carbonate (see Section 11.4).
So, the relative stabilities of these carbonates increase down the group in the order:
BaCO3 > SrCO3 > CaCO3 > MgCO3.
We can explain this trend using ideas about ion polarisation:
the carbonate ion has a relatively large ionic radius so it is easily polarised by a small highly charged
cation
the Group 2 cations increase in ionic radius down the group:
Mg2+ < Ca2+ < Sr2+ < Ba2+
the smaller the ionic radius of the cation, the better it is at polarising the carbonate ion (Figure 19.9)
so the degree of polarisation of the carbonate ion by the Group 2 cation follows the order
Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Sr2+ > Ba2+
the greater the polarisation of the carbonate ion, the easier it is to weaken a carbon–oxygen bond in
the carbonate and form carbon dioxide and the oxide on heating.

Figure 19.9: Magnesium ions are better polarisers of carbonate ions than calcium ions.

A similar pattern is observed with the thermal decomposition of Group 2 nitrates: these decompose to form
the oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen. For example:
2Mg(NO3)2(s) → 2MgO(s) + 4NO2(g) + O2(g)
The order of stability with respect to the products is in the order:
Ba(NO3)2 > Sr(NO3)2 > Ca(NO3)2 > Mg(NO3)2
The difference in thermal stability of Group 2 carbonates can be analysed by comparing Born–Haber cycles
involving the lattice energies of calcium carbonate and calcium oxide. The unequal changes in the lattice
energies of the Group 2 carbonates and the Group 2 oxides as the cation size increases can be related to
the increasing thermal stability down the group.

Question
12 Use ideas about ion polarisation to explain why magnesium nitrate undergoes thermal decomposition
at a much lower temperature than barium nitrate.

19.4 Enthalpy changes in solution
When an ionic solid dissolves in water, the crystal lattice breaks up and the ions separate. It needs a large
amount of energy to overcome the attractive forces between the ions. How does this happen, even when
the water is not heated? We will answer this question in this section.

Enthalpy change of solution

⦵
The standard enthalpy change of solution, ΔHsol
, is the energy absorbed or released when 1 mole of
an ionic solid dissolves in sufficient water to form a very dilute solution.

The enthalpy changes of solution for magnesium chloride and sodium chloride are described by the
equations below:
⦵
ΔHsol
= −55 kJ mol−1

MgCl2(s) + aq → MgCl2(aq)
or

MgCl2(s) + aq → Mg2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq)
NaCl(s) + aq → NaCl(aq)

⦵
ΔHsol
= −55 kJ mol−1

⦵
ΔHsol
= +3.9 kJ mol−1

or
NaCl(s) + aq → Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq)

⦵
ΔHsol
= +3.9 kJ mol−1

Note that:

⦵
the symbol for enthalpy change of solution is ΔHsol

the symbol ‘aq’ represents the very large amount of water used
enthalpy changes of solution can be positive (endothermic) or negative (exothermic)

⦵
a compound is likely to be soluble in water only if ΔHsol
is negative or has a small positive value;
⦵
substances with large positive values of ΔHsol are relatively insoluble.

Question
13 a

b

Write equations to represent the enthalpy change of solution of:
i

potassium sulfate

ii

zinc chloride.

The enthalpies of solution of some metal halides are given below. What do these values tell you
about the relative solubilities of these four compounds?
⦵
sodium chloride, ΔHsol
= +3.9 kJ mol−1
⦵
silver chloride, ΔHsol
= +65.7 kJ mol−1

⦵
sodium bromide, ΔHsol
= −0.6 kJ mol−1
⦵
silver bromide, ΔHsol
= +84.5 kJ mol−1

‘Soluble’ and ‘insoluble’ are only relative terms. We think of magnesium carbonate as being insoluble
because only 0.6 g of the salt dissolves in every dm3 of water. No metallic salts are absolutely insoluble in
water. Even lead carbonate, which is regarded as insoluble, dissolves to a very small extent: 0.00017 g
⦵
dissolves in every dm3 of water. If salts were completely insoluble, they could not have a value for ΔHsol
.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 19.1
Enthalpy change of solution by experiment
SAFETY: Only carry out this activity in the presence of a teacher after safety aspects have been

explained.
The enthalpy change of solution of sodium hydroxide can be found using a polystyrene cup as a
calorimeter. We use known amounts of solute and solvent with the solvent in excess to make sure that
all the solute dissolves.

Procedure
1 Weigh an empty polystyrene cup.
2 Pour 100 cm3 of water into the cup and weigh the cup and water.
3 Record the steady temperature of the water with a thermometer reading to at least the nearest 0.2
°C.
4 Add a few pellets of sodium hydroxide (corrosive!) which have been stored under dry conditions.
5 Keep the mixture stirred continuously with a thermometer and record the temperature at fixed
intervals, e.g. every 20 seconds.
6 Keep recording the temperature for 5 minutes after the maximum temperature has been reached.
7 Weigh the cup and its contents to calculate the mass of sodium hydroxide which dissolved.

produced a temperature change of +3.6 °C.
energy change, q (in J) = − mass of water (in g) × specific heat capacity × temperature change (in
°C)
= −(100.45 × 4.18 × 3.6)
= −1511.57 J = −1.5 kJ (to 2 significant figures)
The energy change for 1.5 g sodium hydroxide is −1.5 kJ
The enthalpy change for 1.0 mole of sodium hydroxide (Mr = 40 g mol−1)
is

× 1.5 kJ = −40 kJ

⦵
ΔHsol
= −40 kJ mol−1

In this experiment, we are assuming that the specific heat capacity of the solution is the same as the
specific heat capacity of water. The heat losses in this experiment, however, are likely to be
considerable because the sodium hydroxide takes some time to dissolve. This means that the reaction
mixture has a longer period of cooling.

Enthalpy change of hydration
The lattice energy for sodium chloride is −788 kJ mol−1. This means that we need to supply (at least) +788
⦵
kJ mol−1 to overcome the forces of attraction between the ions. But ΔHsol
[NaCl] is only +3.9 kJ mol−1.
Where does the energy needed to separate the ions come from? The answer is that it comes from the
strong attraction between the ions and the water molecules.

When an ionic solid dissolves in water, bonds are formed between water molecules and the ions. These
bonds are called ion–dipole bonds. Water is a polar molecule. The δ− oxygen atoms in water molecules
are attracted to the positive ions in the ionic compound. The δ+ hydrogen atoms in water molecules are
attracted to the negative ions in the ionic compound (Figure 19.10).
The energy released in forming ion–dipole bonds is sufficient to compensate for the energy that must be
put in to separate the anions and cations that are bonded together in the crystal lattice.

Figure 19.10: a Water molecules forming ion–dipole bonds with an ionic compound. b Hydrated ions in solution.

The energy released when gaseous ions dissolve in water is called the standard enthalpy change of
hydration.

⦵
The enthalpy change of hydration, ΔHhyd
, is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a specified gaseous ion
dissolves in sufficient water to form a very dilute solution.

The enthalpy changes of hydration for calcium ions and chloride ions are described by the equations below:
Ca2+(g) + aq → Ca2+(aq)
Cl−(g) + aq → Cl−(aq)

⦵
ΔHhyd
−1650 kJ mol−1
⦵
ΔHhyd
−364 kJ mol−1

Note:

⦵
the symbol for enthalpy change of hydration is ΔHhyd

the enthalpy change of hydration is always exothermic

⦵
⦵
the value of ΔHhyd
is more exothermic for ions with the same charge but smaller ionic radii, e.g. ΔHhyd
is
+
+
more exothermic for Li than for Na . The charge density is greater for lithium than for sodium
because the ionic radius of Li+ is smaller and there is less shielding than for Na+. This effect is greater
than the effect of increased nuclear charge present in Na+. Water is a polar molecule. So ion–dipole
attractions between water and Li+ are stronger than ion–dipole attractions between water and Na+.
⦵
⦵
the value of ΔHhyd
is more exothermic for ions with the same radii but a larger charge, e.g. ΔHhyd
is
2+
+
more exothermic for Mg than for Li . The charge density is greater for magnesium than for lithium
because the charge on Mg2+ is greater for the same size of atom. There are also a greater number of
positive charges in the nucleus. So ion–dipole attractions between water and Mg2+ are stronger than
ion–dipole attractions between water and Li+.

Calculating enthalpy changes in solution
We can calculate the enthalpy change of solution or the enthalpy change of hydration by constructing an
energy cycle and using Hess’s law (Figure 19.11).

Table 19.3: Solubilities in water of some Group 2 sulfates.

Change in hydration enthalpy down the group
Smaller ions (with the same charge) have greater enthalpy changes of hydration
so the enthalpy change of hydration decreases (gets less exothermic) in the order:
Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Sr2+ > Ba2+
this decrease is relatively large down the group and it depends entirely on the increase in the size of
the cation, as the anion is unchanged (it is the sulfate ion in every case).

Change in lattice energy down the group
Lattice energy is greater if the ions (with the same charge) forming the lattice are small
so the lattice energy decreases in the order:
Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Sr2+ > Ba2+
the lattice energy is also inversely proportional to the sum of the radii of the anion and cation
the sulfate ion is much larger than the Group 2 cations
so the sulfate ion contributes a relatively greater part to the change in the lattice energy down the
group
so the decrease in lattice energy is relatively smaller down the group and it is determined more by the
size of the large sulfate ion than the size of the cations.

Difference in enthalpy change of solution of Group 2 sulfates
Earlier in this section we saw that substances that have a very low solubility in water are likely to have
⦵
⦵
ΔHsol
with a high positive (endothermic) value. As a rough guide, the higher the positive value of ΔHsol
the

less soluble the salt.

Figure 19.15: Enthalpy cycles comparing the enthalpy change of solution of calcium sulfate and strontium sulfate.

We have seen that:
the lattice energy of the sulfates decreases (gets less exothermic) by relatively smaller values down
the group
the enthalpy change of hydration decreases (gets less exothermic) by relatively larger values down the
group
⦵
so applying Hess’s law, the value of ΔHsol
gets more endothermic down the group (Figure 19.15)

so the solubility of the Group 2 sulfates decreases down the group.

use the Nernst equation

⦵

to predict quantitatively how the value of an electrode

potential varies with the concentration of the aqueous ions.

BEFORE YOU START
1

Explain to another learner the meaning of the terms reversible reaction, equilibrium and Le
Chatelier’s principle.

2

Make a list of the factors that affect an equilibrium reaction. Choose an equilibrium reaction from
Chapter 8 in the coursebook and work with another learner to suggest how these factors affect the
position of that particular equilibrium.

3

Work with another learner. Take it in turns to explain the meaning of the terms electrolysis, anode,
cathode, electrolyte, anion and cation. If you do not agree or are not sure, check with a textbook or
the internet.

4

Make a list of compound ions (e.g. MnO4−, SO32−) or compounds (e.g MnO2). Share this list with
another learner, then deduce the oxidation number of the metal in the ion or more electropositive
non-metal in the compound. Compare your answers with the other learner.

5

Take turns in challenging another learner to define these terms: redox, oxidation, reduction,
disproportionation, oxidation number, oxidising agent and reducing agent. If you do not agree or
are not sure, check your answers with the definitions given in the coursebook.

6

Explain to another learner the meaning of the terms Avogadro constant, standard conditions and
mole.

7

Ask another learner to write down an unbalanced ion–electron equation (half equation) from
Appendix 2 of the coursebook but without including the electron(s), e.g. O2 + 4H+ → 2H2O. The
equation can be written either as shown or reversed. You then have to balance the equation. Do
this by adding electrons to one or other side of the equation so that it balances. Then reverse the
process: you select the equation and the other learner balances it. Continue until you are sure that
you can balance these equations.

GETTING RID OF THE POISONS

Figure 20.1: This land has been contaminated by poisonous ions such as cadmium ions and cyanide ions. We can
use electrochemistry to remove these ions.

In many places in the world, the land once occupied by old chemical industries, gasworks or fertiliser
factories cannot be built on. This is because the ground is polluted with poisonous substances such as
cadmium ions, Cd2+, copper ions, Cu2+, or cyanide ions, CN− (Figure 20.1). Some countries have laws
to prevent these ‘brown field sites’ from being used until the poisons have been removed.
Electrochemistry can be used to remove some of these pollutants from the soil (Figure 20.2).
The surface of soil particles can be positively or negatively charged. Sometimes both charges are
present on the surface of a single particle. The surface of negatively charged soil particles can attract
positive ions such as Cd2+ or Cu2+ and hold them in place by ionic bonding. These harmful positive
ions can be removed by ion exchange (the swapping of one ion by another). The process works like a
battery in reverse.

Figure 20.2: Exchanging ions in the soil by an electrochemical method.

Electrical energy from a power supply is passed through a chemical cell, which is made part of the
soil. In practice, several pairs of electrodes are used.
The electrodes contain an ion-exchange membrane on the outside of an acid electrolyte, which
circulates throughout the electrode.
The electrical energy breaks down water to OH− ions at the cell cathode and H+ ions at the cell
anode.
The OH− ions and H+ ions from this reaction pass through the water between the soil particles to
the opposite electrodes.

Some of the H+ ions replace metal cations such as Cd2+ on the surface of the soil particles and
some of the OH− ions replace anions such as CN−. When this happens, the Cd2+ and CN− ions are
released from the surface of the soil particles and go into solution.
The Cd2+ ions move to the negative electrode and the CN− ions move to positive electrode. These
poisonous ions are then removed in the circulating electrolyte.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Suggest an advantage and disadvantage of this electrochemical process.
Work with another learner to do some research using books or the internet to find out why cyanide
ions are so poisonous and why nitrate ions, although present in fertilisers, are not good for the
environment.
Suggest why so many ‘brown field sites’ still exist in the world. Someone stated that ‘the number
of these polluted brown field sites is almost certain to increase in great number’. Suggest why this
is not necessarily true.

20.1 Redox reactions revisited
In Chapter 7, you learned to construct equations for redox reactions from relevant half-equations. You also
used the concept of oxidation numbers to show whether a particular reactant has been oxidised or reduced
during a chemical reaction.
Electrons may be gained or lost in redox reactions.
The species (atom, ion or molecule) losing electrons is being oxidised. It acts a reducing agent.
The species gaining electrons is being reduced. It acts an oxidising agent.

20.2 Electrolysis
Electrolytic cells
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a compound into its elements by an electric current. It is often used
to extract metals that are high in the reactivity series. These metals cannot be extracted by heating their
ores with carbon. Electrolysis is also used to produce non-metals such as chlorine and to purify some
metals. Electrolysis is generally carried out in an electrolysis cell (Figure 20.3).

Figure 20.3: The main parts of an electrolysis cell. The actual structure of the cell will vary according to the element
extracted. The e− shows the direction of travel of the electrons around the external circuit.

In the electrolysis cell:
the electrolyte is the compound that is decomposed. It is either a molten ionic compound or a
concentrated aqueous solution of ions
the electrodes are rods, made from either carbon (graphite) or metal, which conduct electricity to and
from the electrolyte
the anode is the positive electrode
the cathode is the negative electrode
the power supply must be direct current.

Question
3

a

Why does an ionic compound have to be molten to undergo electrolysis?

b

Give two properties of graphite that make it a suitable material for use as an electrode. Explain
your answers.

Redox reactions in electrolysis
IMPORTANT
During electrolysis, reduction occurs at the cathode because ions gain electrons from the cathode, and
oxidation occurs at the anode because ions lose electrons to the anode.
During electrolysis, the positive ions (cations) move to the cathode. When they reach the cathode they
gain electrons from the cathode. For example:
Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu
2H+ + 2e− → H2

Gain of electrons is reduction. Reduction always occurs at the cathode.
If metal atoms are formed, they may be deposited as a layer of metal on the cathode. Alternatively, they
may form a molten layer in the cell. If hydrogen gas is formed, it bubbles off.
The negative ions (anions) move to the anode. When they reach the anode they lose electrons to the
anode. For example:
2Cl− → Cl2 + 2e−
4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−
Loss of electrons is oxidation. Oxidation always occurs at the anode.
Electrolysis is a redox reaction. For example, when molten zinc chloride is electrolysed the electrode
reactions are:
cathode: Zn2+ + 2e− → Zn (reduction)
anode: 2Cl− → Cl2 + 2e− (oxidation)
The electron loss at the anode balances the electron gain at the cathode. Overall, the reaction is:
ZnCl2 → Zn + Cl2

Question
4

a

Explain why cations move towards the cathode during electrolysis.

b

When lead iodide, PbI2, is electrolysed, the following reactions occur:

ii

Which of these equations describes the reaction at the cathode? Explain your answer.

iii

State the ox. no. change of each iodide ion in the reaction
2I− → I2 + 2e−

20.3 Quantitative electrolysis
The mass of substance deposited during electrolysis
The mass of a substance produced at an electrode during electrolysis is proportional to:
the time over which a constant electric current passes
the strength of the electric current.
Combining current and time, we get the relationship:

The mass of a substance produced at (or removed from) an electrode during electrolysis is proportional to
the quantity of electricity (in coulombs) which passes through the electrolyte.
We can express the quantity of electricity in terms of a unit called the faraday (symbol F). One faraday is
the quantity of electric charge carried by 1 mole of electrons or 1 mole of singly charged ions. Its value is
96 500 C mol−1 (to 3 significant figures). So the relationship between the Faraday and the Avogadro
constant is F = Le where e is the charge on an electron.
During the electrolysis of silver nitrate solution, silver is deposited at the cathode:
Ag+(aq)

+

1 mol

e−

→

1 mol

Ag(s)
1 mol

One faraday of electricity (96 500 C) is required to deposit 1 mole of silver.
During the electrolysis of copper(II) sulfate solution, copper is deposited at the cathode:
Cu2+(aq)

+

1 mol

2e−

→

2 mol

Cu(s)
1 mol

The equation shows that you need 2 moles of electrons to produce 1 mole of copper from Cu2+ ions. So it
requires two faradays of electricity (2 × 96 500 C) to deposit 1 mole of copper.
During the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, chlorine is produced at the anode:
2Cl−(aq)
2 mol

→

Cl2(g)

+

1 mol

2e−
2 mol

The equation shows that 2 moles of electrons are released when 1 mole of chlorine gas is formed from 2
moles of Cl− ions. So it requires two faradays of electricity (2 × 96 500 C) to produce 1 mole of Cl2.
During the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid or aqueous sodium sulfate, oxygen is
produced at the anode:
4OH−(aq) → O2(g) + 2H2O(l) + 4e−
The equation shows that 4 moles of electrons are released when 1 mole of oxygen gas is formed from 4
moles of OH− ions. So it requires 4 faradays of electricity (4 × 96 500 C) to produce 1 mole of O2.

Calculating amount of substance produced during electrolysis

We can use the value of F to calculate:
the mass of substance deposited at an electrode
the volume of gas produced at an electrode.

WORKED EXAMPLES
1

Calculate the mass of lead deposited at the cathode during electrolysis when a current of 1.50 A
flows through molten lead(II) bromide for 20.0 min.
(Ar value: [Pb] = 207; F = 96 500 C mol−1)

Solution
Step 1:

Write the half-equation for the reaction.
Pb2+ + 2e− → Pb

Step 2:

Find the number of coulombs required to deposit 1 mole of product at the electrode.
2 moles of electrons are required per mole of Pb formed:
= 2F
= 2 × 96 500
= 193 000 C mol−1

Step 3:

Calculate the charge transferred during the electrolysis.
Q=I×t
= 1.50 × 20 × 60
= 1800 C

Step 4:

Calculate the mass by simple proportion using the relative atomic mass.
193 000 C deposits 1 mole Pb, which is 207 g Pb
so 1800 C deposits

× 207

= 1.93 g Pb
2

Calculate the volume of oxygen produced at r.t.p. when a concentrated aqueous solution of sulfuric
acid, H2SO4, is electrolysed for 30.0 min using a current of 0.50 A.
(F = 96 500 C mol−1; 1 mole of gas occupies 24.0 dm3 at r.t.p.)

Solution
Step 1:

Write the half-equation for the reaction.
4OH−(aq) → O2(g) + 2H2O(l) + 4e−

Step 2:

Find the number of coulombs required to produce 1 mole of gas.
4 moles of electrons are released per mole of O2 formed:
= 4F
= 4 × 96 500
= 386 000 C mol−1

Step 3:

Calculate the charge transferred during the electrolysis.
Q=I×t
= 0.50 × 30 × 60
= 900 C

Step 4:

Calculate the volume by simple proportion using the relationship 1 mole of gas occupies
24.0 dm3 at r.t.p.

386 000 C produces 1 mole O2, which is 24 dm3 O2
so 900 C produces

× 24.0

= 0.0560 dm3 O2 at r.t.p.

sulfate is electrolysed for 55.0 min using a current of 0.70 A.

Calculating the Avogadro constant by an electrolytic method
The Avogadro constant, L, is the number of specified particles in 1 mole (see Section 3.4).
We can use an electrolytic method to find a value for the Avogadro constant by calculating the charge
associated with 1 mole of electrons.

We can calculate the charge on the electron by experiment. The results show us that the charge on the
electron is approximately 1.60 × 10−19 C.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 20.1
Finding the charge on 1 mole of electrons
The charge on 1 mole of electrons can be found from a simple electrolytic experiment. The apparatus
for this is shown in Figure 20.4.

Figure 20.4: Apparatus for calculating the mass of copper deposited during the electrolysis of aqueous copper(II)
sulfate.

Procedure
weigh the pure copper anode and pure copper cathode separately
arrange the apparatus as shown in Figure 20.4; the variable resistor is used to keep the current
constant (about 0.2 amps)
pass a constant electric current for a measured time interval (e.g. 40 minutes exactly)
remove the cathode and anode and wash and dry them with distilled water and then with propanone
reweigh the cathode and anode.
The cathode increases in mass because copper is deposited. The anode decreases in mass because
the copper goes into solution as copper ions. The decrease in mass of the anode is measured. This is
preferred because the copper does not always ‘stick’ to the cathode very well.
A sample calculation is shown below, using a current of 0.20 A for 34 min.
mass of anode at start of the experiment = 56.53 g
mass of anode at end of experiment

= 56.40 g

mass of copper removed from anode

= 0.13 g

quantity of charge passed Q = L × t
= 0.20 × 34 × 60
= 408 C
To deposit 0.13 g of copper requires 408 C, so to deposit 1 mole of copper (63.5 g) requires
C

× 408

But the equation for the electrolysis shows that 2 moles of electrons are needed to produce 1 mole of
copper:
Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu
The charge on 1 mole of electrons =

= 99 646 C
If the charge on one electron is 1.60 × 10−19 C,

This is in good agreement with the accurate value of 6.02 × 1023 mol−1.

Questions

A learner passed a constant electric current of 0.15 A through a solution of silver nitrate, using pure
silver electrodes, for 45 min exactly. The mass of the anode decreased by 0.45 g. Use this data to
calculate the charge on a mole of electrons.
(Ar value: [Ag] = 108)

9

An accurate value of the Faraday constant is 96 485 C mol−1. An accurate value for the charge on one
electron is 1.6022 × 10−19 C. Use these values to calculate a value of the Avogadro constant to 5
significant figures.

20.4 Electrode potentials
Introducing electrode potentials
A redox equilibrium exists between two chemically related species that are in different oxidation states. For
example, when a copper rod is placed in contact with an aqueous solution of its ions the following
equilibrium exists:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu(s)
There are two opposing reactions in this equilibrium.
Metal atoms from the rod entering the solution as metal ions. This leaves electrons behind on the
surface of the rod. For example:
Cu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2e−
Ions in solution accepting electrons from the metal rod and being deposited as metal atoms on the
surface of the rod. For example:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− → Cu(s)
The redox equilibrium is established when the rate of electron gain equals the rate of electron loss.
For unreactive metals such as copper, if this equilibrium is compared with the equilibrium set up by other
metals, the equilibrium set up by copper lies further over to the right.
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu(s)
Cu2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively easy to reduce. They gain electrons readily to form copper metal.
For reactive metals such as vanadium, the equilibrium lies further over to the left.
V2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ V(s)
V2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively difficult to reduce. They gain electrons much less readily by
comparison.
The position of equilibrium differs for different combinations of metals placed in solutions of their ions.
When we place a metal into a solution of its ions, we establish an electric potential (voltage) between the
metal and the metal ions in solution. We cannot measure this potential directly. But we can measure the
difference in potential between the metal / metal ion system and another system. We call this value the
electrode potential, E. Electrode potential is measured in volts. The system we use for comparison is the
standard hydrogen electrode.
Scientists think the absolute electrical potentials that we cannot measure are caused by the formation of
an electrical double layer when an element is placed in a solution of its ions. For example, when zinc is
placed in a solution containing zinc ions, a tiny number of zinc atoms on the surface of the metal are
converted to zinc ions, which go into solution. This leaves an excess of electrons on the surface of the zinc.
The solution around the metal now has excess Zn2+ ions. Some of these cations near the surface of the
zinc are attracted to its surface. So an electrical double layer is formed. This build-up of charge causes an
electric potential (voltage) between the metal and the metal ions in solution (Figure 20.5).

Figure 20.5: The separation of charge when a zinc rod is placed in a solution of Zn2+ ions results in an electrical double
layer.

The standard hydrogen electrode
The standard hydrogen electrode is one of several types of half-cell that can be used as reference
electrodes. Figure 20.6 shows a standard hydrogen electrode.

Figure 20.6: The standard hydrogen electrode.

This electrode consists of:
hydrogen gas at 101 kPa pressure, in equilibrium with H+ ions of concentration 1.00 mol dm−3
a platinum electrode covered with platinum black in contact with the hydrogen gas and the H+ ions.
The platinum black is finely divided platinum. This allows close contact of hydrogen gas and H+ ions in
solution so that equilibrium between H2 gas and H+ ions is established quickly. The platinum electrode is
inert so it does not take part in the reaction.

We measure standard electrode potential E⦵ values for all half-cells relative to this electrode. When
connected to another half-cell, the value read on the voltmeter gives the standard electrode potential for
that half-cell.
The half-equation for the hydrogen electrode can be written:
2H+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ H2(g)
or
H+(aq) + e− ⇌

H2(g)

The way that you balance the half-equation makes no difference to the value of E⦵. The equation does not
affect the tendency for the element to gain electrons.

Electrode potential and redox reactions
Electrode potential values give us an indication of how easy it is to reduce a substance.
Note that:
By convention, the electrode potential refers to the reduction reaction. So the electrons appear on the
left-hand side of the half-equation. For example:
Al3+(aq) + 3e− ⇌ Al(s)
The more positive (or less negative) the electrode potential, the easier it is to reduce the ions on the
left. So the metal on the right is relatively unreactive and is a relatively poor reducing agent. For
example:
Ag+(aq) + e− ⇌ Ag(s)

voltage = +0.80 V

The more negative (or less positive) the electrode potential, the more difficult it is to reduce the ions
on the left. So the metal on the right is relatively reactive and is a relatively good reducing agent. For
example:
Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)

voltage = −0.76 V

20.5 Combining half-cells

Figure 20.7: The Cu2+ / Cu half-cell.

In order to measure the electrode potential relating to the half-equation
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− → Cu(s)
we place a pure copper rod in a solution of Cu2+(aq) ions (for example copper(II) sulfate solution). This
Cu2+ / Cu system is called a half-cell (Figure 20.7).
We use the following standard conditions to make the half-cell:
the Cu2+(aq) ions have a concentration of 1.00 mol dm−3
the temperature is 25 °C (298 K)
the rod must be pure copper.
If we connect two half-cells together, we have made an electrochemical cell. We can measure the voltage
between these two half-cells. Figure 20.8 shows a Cu2+ / Cu half-cell connected to a Zn2+ / Zn half-cell to
make a complete electrochemical cell.
Half-cells are connected together using:
wires connecting the metal rods in each half-cell to a high-resistance voltmeter. The electrons flow
round this external circuit from the metal with the more negative (or less positive) electrode potential
to the metal with the less negative (or more positive) electrode potential
a salt bridge to complete the electrical circuit allowing the movement of ions between the two halfcells so that ionic balance is maintained. A salt bridge does not allow the movement of electrons.
A salt bridge can be made from a strip of filter paper (or other inert porous material) soaked in a saturated
solution of potassium nitrate.

Figure 20.8: One type of electrochemical cell is made by connecting a Cu2+ / Cu half-cell to a Zn2+ / Zn half-cell. The
voltage generated by this cell is +1.10 V.

The voltages for the half-cells in Figure 20.8 can be represented by the following half-equations:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu(s)
Zn

2+

−

(aq) + 2e ⇌ Zn(s)

voltage = +0.34 V
voltage = −0.76 V

The relative values of these voltages tell us that Zn2+ ions are more difficult to reduce than Cu2+ ions. So
Cu2+ ions will accept electrons from the Zn2+ / Zn half-cell and zinc will lose electrons to the Cu2+ / Cu halfcell.
Half-equations can be used to show us the contents of half-cells. A half-cell does not have to be a metal /
metal ion system. We can construct half-cells for any half-equation written. For example:
Fe3+(aq) + e− ⇌ Fe2+(aq)
Cl2(g) + 2e− ⇌ 2Cl−(aq)
MnO4−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e− ⇌ Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)
Note that the oxidised species (having the higher oxidation number) is always written on the left-hand side
and the reduced form on the right-hand side.

Question

b

Suggest why aqueous silver nitrate is not used in a salt bridge when connecting a half-cell
containing Zn and 1.00 mol dm−3 ZnCl2(aq) to another half-cell.
Write half-equations for the reactions taking place in the half-cells below. Write each equation as a
reduction (electrons on the left-hand side of the equation).
i

Cr2+ / Cr3+

ii

Br2 / 2Br −

iii

O2 + H2O / OH− (make sure that you balance the equation)

iv

VO2+ + H2O / VO2+ + H+ (make sure that you balance the equation)

Standard electrode potential
The position of equilibrium of a reaction may be affected by changes in the concentration of reagents,
temperature and pressure of gases. The voltage of an electrochemical cell will also depend on these
factors, so we should use standard conditions when comparing electrode potentials. These are:

concentration of ions at 1.00 mol dm−3
a temperature of 25 °C (298 K)
any gases should be at a pressure of 1 atmosphere (101 kPa)
the value of the electrode potential of the half-cell is measured relative to the standard hydrogen
electrode.
Under these conditions, the electrode potential we measure is called the standard electrode potential.
This has the symbol, E⦵. It is spoken of as ‘E standard’. These are sometimes referred to as standard
reduction potentials because they refer to the reduction reaction (addition of electrons).
The standard electrode potential for a half-cell is the voltage measured under standard conditions with a
standard hydrogen electrode as the other half-cell.

Measuring standard electrode potentials

There are three main types of half-cell whose E⦵ value can be obtained when connected to a standard
hydrogen electrode:
metal / metal ion half-cell
non-metal / non-metal ion half-cell
ion / ion half-cell.

Half-cells containing metals and metal ions

Figure 20.9 shows how to measure the E⦵ value for a Cu2+ / Cu half-cell. The Cu2+ / Cu half-cell is
connected to a standard hydrogen electrode and the voltage measured. The voltage is +0.34 V. The copper
is the positive terminal (positive pole) of the cell and the hydrogen electrode is the negative terminal. The
two half-equations are:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu(s)
H+(aq) + e− ⇌

H2(g)

E⦵ = +0.34 V
E⦵ = 0.00 V

Figure 20.9: Measuring the standard electrode potential of a Cu2+ / Cu half-cell.

The E⦵ values show us that Cu2+ ions are easier to reduce than H+ ions (they have a more positive E⦵
value).
Cu2+ ions are more likely to gain electrons than H+ ions.
So Cu2+ ions will accept electrons from the H+ / H2 half-cell and H2 will lose electrons to the Cu2+ / Cu
half-cell.

Figure 20.10 shows how to measure the E⦵ value for a Zn2+ / Zn half-cell. The voltage of the Zn2+ / Zn half-

cell is −0.76 V. The zinc is the negative terminal (negative pole) of the cell and the hydrogen electrode is
the positive terminal. The two half-equations are:
H+(aq) + e− ⇌
Zn

2+

H2(g)

−

(aq) + 2e ⇌ Zn(s)

E⦵ = 0.00 V
E⦵ = −0.76 V

The E⦵ values show us that Zn2+ ions are more difficult to reduce than H+ ions (they have a more
negative E⦵ value).
Zn2+ ions are less likely to gain electrons than H+ ions.
So Zn will lose electrons to the H+ / H2 half-cell and H+ ions will gain electrons from the Zn2+ / Zn halfcell.

Figure 20.10: Measuring the standard electrode potential of a Zn2+ / Zn half-cell.

From these two examples, we can see that:
Reduction takes place at the positive terminal of the cell. For example, in the Zn2+ / Zn; H+ / H2 cell:
H+(aq) + e− ⇌

H2(g)

Oxidation takes place at the negative terminal of the cell. For example, in the Zn2+ / Zn: H+ / H2 cell:
Zn(s) ⇌ Zn2+(aq) + 2e−

Question
12 a

Write half-equations for the three reactions taking place in the half-cells shown on the left in
Figure 20.11.

Figure 20.11: Measuring standard electrode potentials.

b

What are the standard electrode potentials for these half-cell reactions?

c

List all the necessary conditions in each cell.

Half-cells containing non-metals and non-metal ions
In half-cells that do not contain a metal, electrical contact with the solution is made by using platinum wire
or platinum foil as an electrode. The redox equilibrium is established at the surface of the platinum. The
platinum electrode is inert and so plays no part in the reaction.
The platinum must be in contact with both the element and the aqueous solution of its ions.
Figure 20.12 shows a Cl2 / Cl− half-cell connected to a standard hydrogen electrode. The voltage of the Cl2 /
Cl− half-cell is +1.36 V. So the Cl2 / Cl− half-cell forms the positive terminal of the cell and the hydrogen
electrode is the negative terminal. The two half-equations are:
Cl2(g) + e− ⇌ Cl−(aq)
H+(aq) + e− ⇌ H2(g)

E⦵ = +1.36 V
E⦵ = 0.00 V

The E⦵ values show us that Cl2 molecules are easier to reduce than H+ ions (they have a more positive
E⦵ value).
Cl2 molecules are more likely to gain electrons than H+ ions.
So Cl2 molecules will gain electrons from the H+ /
the Cl2 / Cl− half-cell.

H2 half-cell and H2 molecules will lose electrons to

Look at Figure 20.13. Write a half-equation for the half-cell on the left-hand side.
What is the E⦵ value for this half-cell?

14 Draw a diagram to show how you would measure the standard electrode potential for the half-cell:
I2 + e− ⇌ I−(aq)

Include the actual E⦵ value of +0.54 V on your diagram.

Half-cells containing ions of the same element in different oxidation states
Half-cells can contain two ions of different oxidation states derived from the same element. For example, a
mixture of Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions can form a half-cell using a platinum electrode. In this type of half-cell, the
concentration of each ion present is 1.00 mol dm−3. Figure 20.14 shows the set-up for a cell used to
measure the standard electrode potential of the Fe3+ / Fe2+ half-cell.

Figure 20.14: Measuring the standard electrode potential of the Fe3+ / Fe2+ half-cell.

The voltage of this half-cell is +0.77 V.
Fe3+(aq) + e− ⇌ Fe2+(aq)

E⦵ = +0.77 V

Some reactions involve several ionic species. For example:
MnO4−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e− ⇌ Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)
The H+ ions are included because they are essential for the conversion of MnO4− (manganate(VII) ions) to
Mn2+ ions.
So the half-cell contains:
1.00 mol dm−3 MnO4−(aq) ions
1.00 mol dm−3 Mn2+(aq) ions
1.00 mol dm−3 H+(aq) ions.
Figure 20.15 shows the set-up of a cell used to measure the standard electrode potential of the MnO4− /
Mn2+ half-cell.

equation:
VO2+ + 2H+ + e− ⇌ V3+ + H2O

20.6 Using E⦵ values

Using E⦵ values to predict cell voltages

We can use E⦵ values to calculate the voltage of an electrochemical cell made up of two half-cells, even
when neither of them is a standard hydrogen electrode. The voltage measured is the difference between
the E⦵ values of the two half-cells. We call this value the standard cell potential.
For the electrochemical cell shown in Figure 20.16, the two relevant half-equations are:
Ag+(aq) + e− ⇌ Ag(s)
Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)

E⦵ = +0.80 V
E⦵ = −0.76 V

The voltage of this cell is +0.80 − (−0.76) = +1.56 V (Figure 20.17).

Note that in order to calculate the cell voltage, we always subtract the less positive E⦵ value from the more
positive E⦵ value.

Figure 20.16: An Ag+ / Ag, Zn2+ / Zn electrochemical cell.

Figure 20.17: The difference between +0.80 V and −0.76 V is +1.56 V.

The E⦵ value for the Ag+ / Ag half-cell is more positive than for the Zn2+ / Zn half-cell. So the Ag+ / Ag halfcell is the positive pole and the Zn2+ / Zn half-cell is the negative pole of the cell.
For the electrochemical cell shown in Figure 20.18, the relevant half-equations are:
Fe3+(aq) + e− ⇌ Fe2+(aq)
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu(s)

E⦵ = +0.77 V
E⦵ = +0.34 V

The voltage of this cell is +0.77 − (+0.34) = +0.43 V.

The E⦵ value for the Fe3+ / Fe2+ half-cell is more positive than for the Cu2+ / Cu half-cell. So the Fe3+ / Fe2+
half-cell is the positive pole and the Cu2+ / Cu half-cell is the negative pole of the cell.

Figure 20.18: A Cu+ / Cu, Fe3+ / Fe2+ electrochemical cell.

E⦵ values and the direction of electron flow

We can deduce the direction of electron flow in the wires in the external circuit by comparing the E⦵ values
for the two half-cells which make up the electrochemical cell. For example, in Figure 20.16 these voltages
are:
Ag+(aq) + e− ⇌ Ag(s)
Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)

E⦵ = +0.80 V
E⦵ = −0.76 V

The relative values of these voltages tell us that Zn2+ ions are more difficult to reduce than Ag+ ions. So:
Zn metal will lose electrons to the Ag+ / Ag half-cell
Ag+ ions will accept electrons from the Zn2+ / Zn half-cell.

The electrons move through the wires in the external circuit. They do not travel through the electrolyte
solution.
So the electron flow is from the Zn2+ / Zn half-cell to the Ag+ / Ag half-cell. In other words, the flow is from
the negative pole to the positive pole. It may help you to remember that the more positive pole attracts
the negative electrons.

IMPORTANT
1 The positive pole of a cell is the half-cell which has the less negative or more positive E⦵ value.
2 The direction of electron flow through the external circuit is from the half-cell with the more
negative (less positive) value of E⦵ to the half-cell with the less negative (or more positive) value of
E⦵.

In the electrochemical cell in Figure 20.18, the electrons move in the external circuit from the Cu2+ / Cu
half-cell to the Fe3+ / Fe2+ half-cell.
Fe3+(aq) + e− ⇌ Fe2+(aq)
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu(s)

E⦵ = +0.77 V
E⦵ = +0.34 V

The negative pole of this cell is provided by the Cu2+ / Cu half-cell. This because the Cu2+ / Cu half-cell is
better at losing electrons than the Fe3+ / Fe2+ half-cell.

Using E⦵ values to predict if a reaction will occur

Standard electrode potential values, E⦵, give us a measure of how easy or difficult it is to oxidise or reduce
a species. We can compare the oxidising and reducing powers of elements and ions by comparing the E⦵
values for their half reactions.

Figure 20.19 compares the oxidising and reducing powers of selected elements and ions. The E⦵ values are
listed in order of increasingly negative values. For each half-equation, the more oxidised form is on the left
and the more reduced form is on the right.
The more positive the value of E⦵, the greater the tendency for the half-equation to proceed in the
forward direction.
The less positive the value of E⦵, the greater the tendency for the half-equation to proceed in the
reverse direction.

The more positive the value of E⦵, the easier it is to reduce the species on the left of the half-equation.

The less positive the value of E⦵, the easier it is to oxidise the species on the right of the half-equation.
We can make an electrochemical cell from the two half-cells:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu(s)
Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)

E⦵ = +0.34 V
E⦵ = −0.76 V

When these two half-cells are connected together, a reaction takes place in each of the half-cells. The E⦵
values can be used to predict whether the reaction happening in each half-cell is a reduction (i.e. forward
direction) reaction, or an oxidation (i.e. backwards direction) reaction. If the reactions happening in each
half-cell are combined, we can produce an ionic equation for the reaction that takes place in the
electrochemical cell as a whole.
Cu2+ has a greater tendency to gain electrons than Zn2+, so the chemical reaction that proceeds in this
half-cell is in the forward direction:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− → Cu(s)
Zn has a greater tendency to lose electrons than Cu. This means the chemical reaction that proceeds in
this half-cell is in the reverse direction:
Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e−
We can combine these two half-equations to show the direction of the reaction in the electrochemical cell
as a whole.
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
This is the reaction taking place in the electrochemical cell. But it is also the reaction that takes place if a
piece of zinc metal is placed directly into a 1.00 mol dm−3 solution of Cu2+ ions. A reaction is said to be
feasible if it is likely to occur. The reaction between zinc metal and copper ions is feasible.

Figure 20.19: Standard electrode potentials for some oxidising and reducing agents.

If the forward reaction is feasible, the reverse reaction (between Cu metal and zinc ions) is not feasible. If a
piece of copper metal is placed directly into a 1.00 mol dm−3 solution of Zn2+ ions, no reaction takes place.
We can predict whether a reaction is likely to occur by referring to a list of half-reactions with their E⦵
values listed in descending order from most positive to most negative (see Figure 20.20). When we select
two half-equations, the direction of the reaction is given by a clockwise pattern (reactant, product,
reactant, product) starting from the top left as shown in Figure 20.21 for the cell made from the two halfcells Cu2+ / Cu and Zn2+ / Zn.

Figure 20.20: As predicted by the E⦵ values, zinc reacts with Cu2+ ions but copper does not react with Zn2+ ions.

Figure 20.21: A reaction occurs in a direction so that the stronger oxidising agent reacts with the stronger reducing
agent.

The following Worked examples shows how we can use E⦵ values to predict whether a reaction occurs or
not.

IMPORTANT
1 When two half-cells are joined, the half-cell with the more positive value of E⦵ accepts electrons
more readily and the reaction proceeds in the forward direction.
2 A redox reaction occurs in the direction where the better oxidising agent reacts with the better
reducing agent.

WORKED EXAMPLE
3

Will chlorine oxidise Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions?

Solution

• Write down the two half-equations with the more positive E⦵ value first.
Cl2(g) + e− ⇌ Cl−(aq)

E⦵ = +1.36 V

Fe3+(aq) + e− → Fe2+(aq)

E⦵ = +0.77 V

• Identify the stronger oxidising agent and the stronger reducing agent.

Cl2 is the better oxidising agent. This is because the more positive value of E⦵ indicates that Cl2
molecules are more likely to accept electrons than are Fe3+ ions.

Fe2+ is the better reducing agent. This is because the more negative value of E⦵ indicates that Fe2+
ions are more likely to release electrons than are Cl− ions.

• The stronger oxidising agent reacts with the stronger reducing agent, meaning that the reaction
is feasible.

• The top reaction goes in the forward direction and the bottom reaction goes in the reverse
direction:
Cl2(g) + e− ⇌ Cl−(aq)
Fe2+(aq) ⇌ Fe3+(aq) + e−

• Combine the two half-equations:
Cl2(g) + Fe2+(aq) → Cl−(aq) + Fe3+(aq)

This reaction is feasible. The prediction made using E⦵ values is correct, this reaction takes place in
a suitable electrochemical cell, or when Cl2 gas is bubbled into a 1.00 mol dm−3 solution of Fe2+
ions.
This means that this reaction:
Cl−(aq) + Fe3+(aq) →

Cl2(g) + Fe2+(aq)

is not feasible. If a 1.00 mol dm−3 solution of Fe3+ ions is added to a 1.00 mol dm−3 solution of Cl−
ions, no reaction takes place. This prediction has been made using E⦵ values, and it is correct.

E⦵ values are a very powerful tool for predicting which redox reactions are feasible, and which ones
are not feasible.

WORKED EXAMPLE
4

Will iodine, I2, oxidise Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions?

Solution

• Give the two half-equations, with most positive E⦵ value first.
Fe3+(aq) + e− ⇌ Fe2+(aq)
I2(aq) + e− ⇌ I−(aq)

E⦵ = +0.77 V

E⦵ = +0.54 V

• Identify the stronger oxidising agent and the stronger reducing agent.
Fe3+ is the better oxidising agent. It is more likely to accept electrons than I2 molecules.
I− is the better reducing agent. It is more likely to release electrons than Fe2+ ions.

• I2 is a relatively weaker oxidising agent and Fe2+ is a relatively weaker reducing agent. So the
reaction is not feasible. (The reaction that is feasible is the reaction between Fe3+ ions and I−
ions.)

Will hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, reduce acidified manganate(VII) ions, MnO4−, to Mn2+ ions?

Solution

• Write down the two half-equations with the more positive E⦵ value first.
MnO4−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e−
⇌ Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)
E⦵ = +1.52 V
O2(g) + 2H+(aq) + 2e−

⇌ H2O2(aq)

E⦵ = +0.68 V

• Identify the stronger oxidising agent and the stronger reducing agent.
The system MnO4− + H+ is the better oxidising agent. It is more likely to accept electrons than
the system O2 + 2H+.

Figure 20.22: If the KMnO4(aq) is acidified, would it be safe to do this in an open lab or would chlorine gas be
produced? You will answer this question in Question 21, part a.

H2O2 is the better reducing agent. It is more likely to release electrons than Mn2+ ions.

• The stronger oxidising agent reacts with the stronger reducing agent, so the reaction is feasible.
• The top reaction goes in the forward direction and the bottom reaction goes in the reverse
direction:
MnO4−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e−
⇌ Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)
H2O2(aq) ⇌ O2(g) + 2H+(aq) + 2e−

• Balance the electrons, so that ten electrons are involved in each half-equation:
2MnO4−(aq) + 16H+(aq) + 10e−
⇌ 2Mn2+(aq) + 8H2O(l)
5H2O2(aq) ⇌ 5O2(g) + 10H+(aq) + 10e−

• Combine the two half-equations:
2MnO4−(aq) + 6H+(aq) + 5H2O2(aq)
⇌ 2Mn2+(aq) + 8H2O(l) + 5O2(g)
Note that 10 H+ ions have been cancelled from each side.
We can use the relative voltage of the half-cells to predict whether a reaction takes place without
considering which species is the best oxidant or reductant. The procedure is given in Worked examples 6
and 7.

WORKED EXAMPLES

Will bromine oxidise silver to silver ions?

Solution
Step 1:

Write the equation for the suggested reaction.
Br2 + Ag → Br− + Ag+

Step 2:

Write the two half-equations:
Br2 + e− ⇌ Br−
Ag ⇌ Ag+ + e−

Step 3:

Include the value of E⦵ for each half-reaction but reverse the sign of the half-equation
showing oxidation (loss of electrons). This is because the data book values are always for
the reduction reaction.
E⦵ = +1.07 V

Br2 + e− ⇌ Br−

E⦵ = −0.80 V

Ag ⇌ Ag+ + e−
Step 4:

Add the two voltages. This is because we are combining the two half-equations.
= +1.07 + (−0.80)
= +0.27 V

Step 5:

If the value of the sum of the two voltages is positive the reaction will occur as written. If
the value of the sum of the two voltages is negative the reaction will not occur.

In this case the sum of the two voltages is positive so bromine will oxidise silver to silver ions.
7

Will iodine oxidise silver to silver ions?

Solution
Step 1:

Write the equation for the suggested reaction.
I2 + Ag → I− + Ag+

Step 2:

The two half-equations are:
I2 + e − ⇌ I−
Ag ⇌ Ag+ + e−

Step 3:

Write the E⦵ values, with the sign reversed for the oxidation reaction.
I2 + e − ⇌ I−
Ag ⇌ Ag+ + e−

Step 4:

E⦵ = +0.54 V

E⦵ = −0.80 V

Add the two voltages.
= +0.54 + (−0.80)
= −0.26 V

Step 5:

The sum of the two voltages is negative, so iodine will not oxidise silver to silver ions.

parts a to d.

E⦵ values and oxidising and reducing agents
IMPORTANT
Remember that oxidising agents accept electrons from another species and reducing agents donate
electrons to another species.
Look back at Figure 20.19. Note the following as the values of E⦵ for each of these reduction reactions gets
more negative.
The species on the left of the equation become weaker oxidising agents. They accept electrons less
readily.
The species on the right of the equation become stronger reducing agents. They release electrons
more readily.
Cu will not reduce Zn2+ ions to Zn. So how can we reduce Zn2+ ions? The answer is to react the Zn2+ ions
with a stronger reducing agent, which should have an E⦵ value more negative than the E⦵ value for Zn2+ /
Zn. In Figure 20.19, we see that the half-equation Mg2+ / Mg has a more negative E⦵ value. So Mg is a
suitable reducing agent.
E⦵ = −0.76 V

Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)

E⦵ = −2.38 V

Mg2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Mg(s)

Zn2+ is the better oxidising agent. It is more likely to accept electrons than Mg2+ ions. Mg is the better
reducing agent. It is more likely to release electrons than Zn.
Nitric acid is a good oxidising agent, but it will not oxidise chloride ions to chlorine. So how can we oxidise
Cl− ions? The answer is to react the Cl− ions with a stronger oxidising agent, which should have an E⦵
value more positive than the E⦵ value for Cl2 / Cl−. The half-equation
MnO4−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e− ⇌ Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)
provides a suitable oxidising agent.

This half-equation has a more positive E⦵ value than that for the Cl2 / Cl− half-equation. So acidified MnO4−
ions are a suitable oxidising agent to oxidise chloride ions to chlorine (see Figure 20.22).
MnO4−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e− ⇌ Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)

E⦵ = +1.52 V

Cl2(g) + e− ⇌ Cl−(aq)

E⦵ = +1.36 V

Acidified MnO4− is the better oxidising agent. It is more likely to accept electrons than Cl2 molecules. Cl− is
the better reducing agent. It is more likely to release electrons than Mn2+.
We can explain the relative oxidising abilities of the halogens in a similar way. The standard electrode
potentials for the halogens are:
F2 + e− ⇌ F−
Cl2 + e− ⇌ Cl−
Br2 + e− ⇌ Br−
I2 + e − ⇌ I−

E⦵ = +2.87 V
E⦵ = +1.36 V
E⦵ = +1.07 V
E⦵ = +0.54 V

Based on these E⦵ values, as we go down Group 17 from F2 to I2, the oxidising ability of the halogen

decreases and the ability of halide ions to act as reducing agents increases (Figure 20.23).

Figure 20.23: Aqueous chlorine displaces bromine from a solution of potassium bromide. We can use E⦵ values to explain
why a halogen higher in Group 17 displaces a halogen lower in the group from a solution of its halide ions.

metal atoms?

b

REFLECTION
1

Write down two half-reactions and their standard electrode potentials from Appendix 2 of this
coursebook. Start by choosing simple examples. Ask another learner to deduce the electrode
potential of the cell and then work together to construct a balanced equation for the reaction.
Then reverse the roles: you choose the half-reactions and the other learner deduces the electrode
potential. Carry on like this until you are both sure that you understand the processes involved.

2

What processes did you go through to calculate the cell potential and balance the equations? What
did you learn about yourself as worked through this?

How does the value of E⦵ vary with ion concentration?

In Chapter 8 we saw that the position of an equilibrium reaction is affected by changes in concentration,
temperature and pressure. Redox equilibria are no different. When we compare the voltage of a standard
half-cell, X, with a standard hydrogen electrode, we are measuring E⦵ for the half-cell X. If we change the
concentration or temperature of half-cell X, the electrode potential also changes. Under these non-standard
conditions we use the symbol E for the electrode potential.
What happens to the electrode potential when we change the concentration of ions in a half-cell? Let us
take an example of a metal / metal ion equilibrium:
E⦵ = −0.76 V

Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)

If [Zn2+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm−3, the value of E becomes less negative / more positive (for
example −0.61 V).
If [Zn2+] is less than 1.00 mol dm−3, the value of E becomes more negative / less positive (for
example, −0.80 V).
We can apply Le Chatelier’s principle to redox equilibria. If we increase the concentration of the species on
the left of the equation, the position of equilibrium will shift to the right. So the value of E becomes more
positive / less negative.
If two different ions are present in the half-cell, we have to consider both ions.
Let us take the equilibrium between Fe3+ ions and Fe2+ ions as an example.
Fe3+ + e−

⇌

1.00 mol dm−3

E⦵ = +0.77 V

Fe2+
1.00 mol dm−3

If [Fe3+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm −3 (keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm−3) the value of E becomes
more positive (for example +0.85 V).
If [Fe3+] is less than 1.00 mol dm−3 (keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm−3) the value of E becomes less
positive (for example +0.70 V).
If [Fe2+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm−3 (keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm−3) the value of E becomes less
positive (for example +0.70 V).
If [Fe2+] is less than 1.00 mol dm−3 (keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm−3) the value of E becomes more
positive (for example +0.85 V).
You can see from the information above that if we increase the concentration of both the Fe3+ and Fe2+
ions, these effects may cancel each other out.
How can we predict whether or not a given reaction will occur under non-standard conditions? The answer
is that if the E⦵ values of the two half-reactions involved differ by more than 0.30 V, then the reaction
predicted by values is highly likely to occur. So chlorine is likely to oxidise Fe2+ ions even if the conditions
are not standard. This is because the difference in their E⦵ values is 0.59 V, which is considerably greater
than 0.30 V.
E⦵ = +1.36 V

Cl2(g) + e− ⇌ Cl−(aq)

E⦵ = +0.77 V

Fe3+(aq) + e− ⇌ Fe2+(aq)

We cannot, however, predict with confidence whether the reaction between MnO4− ions and Cl2 will take
place if the conditions are too far from standard.
MnO4−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e− ⇌ Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)

E⦵ = +1.52 V

Cl2(g) + e− ⇌ Cl−(aq)

E⦵ = +1.36 V

This is because the difference in E⦵ values is 0.16 V, which is considerably smaller than 0.30 V.
The figure of 0.30 V given here to help us to tell if a reaction will still occur under non-standard conditions
is a rough guide only. If E⦵ values differ by less than 0.30 V, non-standard conditions may result in an
unexpected outcome.

Question

26 The half-cell Cr2O72− + 14H+ + 6e− ⇌ 2Cr3+ + 7H2O has an E⦵ value of +1.33 V.
a

Suggest how the value of E⦵ changes if the other species are kept at 1.00 mol dm−3 but:
i

[Cr2O72−] is increased

ii

[H+] is decreased

iii

[Cr3+] is increased.

b

What effect would each of these concentration changes have on the strength of the acidified
Cr2O72− solution as an oxidising agent?

c

What conditions would you use to make a solution of Cr2O72− as strong an oxidising agent as
possible?

d

Use Le Chatelier’s principle to explain your answer to part c.

The Nernst equation
If we consider a cell made up from a silver / silver ion electrode and a copper / copper(II) ion electrode, the
reaction taking place is:
Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ⇌ Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s) E⦵ = +0.46 V

This equation relates to standard conditions for the concentrations of the ions (1.00 mol dm−3). If we
change the concentration of the silver ions, the cell is no longer standard, so we use the symbol Ecell. The
graph, Figure 20.24, shows how the value of Ecell changes with the concentration of silver ions. Note that
we have plotted the value of Ecell against the logarithm of the silver ion concentration.

Figure 20.24: Increasing the concentration of silver ions in the cell reaction Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ⇌ Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s) makes
the value of Ecell more positive.

The effect of concentration and temperature on the value of Ecell can be deduced using the Nernst
equation. For a given electrode, e.g. a Cu(s) / Cu2+(aq) electrode, the relationship is:
⦵

where
E is the electrode potential under non-standard conditions
E⦵ is the standard electrode potential

R is the gas constant, 8.31, in J K−1 mol−1
T is the kelvin temperature
z is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction
F is the value of the Faraday constant in C mol−1
ln is the natural logarithm

[oxidised] refers to the concentration of the oxidised form in the half-equation.
Fortunately for us, for a metal / metal ion electrode, we can simplify this equation in three ways:
The natural logarithm, ln, is related to log to the base 10 by the relationship
ln x = 2.303 log10 x
At standard temperature the values of R, T and F are constant
The equation then becomes
⦵

So for the reaction Fe3+(aq) + e− ⇌ Fe2+(aq) in which the concentration of Fe3+(aq) is 0.50 mol dm−3 and
the concentration of Fe2+(aq) is 1.0 mol dm−3

IMPORTANT
The form of the Nernst equation that you are expected to know is
⦵

Fe3+(aq) is the oxidised form, Fes2+(aq) is the reduced form and z = 1.0
Substituting into the Nernst equation we have:
⦵

For a metal / metal ion electrode, e.g.
Cu2+(aq) + 2e ⇌ Cu(s)
the reduced form is the metal.
Note that the concentration of the metal does not change. So the ratio
[oxidised form], e.g. [Cu

2+

can be written

(aq)]

This means that the relationship becomes:
⦵

[oxidised form]

Note that if the temperature is not 25 °C the full form of the Nernst equation must be used.

Question
27 a

Calculate the value of the electrode potential at 298 K of a Ni(s) / Ni2+(aq) electrode that has a
concentration of Ni2+(aq) ions of 1.5 mol dm−3. E⦵ = −0.25 V.

b

Calculate the electrode potential of a silver / silver ion electrode, Ag(s) / Ag+(aq), at 298 K when
the concentration of Ag+(aq) ions is 0.0002 mol dm−3. E⦵ = +0.80 V.

WORKED EXAMPLE
8

Calculate the value of the electrode potential at 298 K of a Cu(s) / Cu2+(aq) electrode that has a
concentration of Cu2+(aq) ions of 0.001 mol dm−3. E⦵ = +0.34 V

Solution
Substituting the values in the relationship:
E = E⦵ +

E = +0.34 +

log10 [Cu2+(aq)]
log10 (0.001)

E = +0.34 − 0.089 = +0.25 V
Note how log10 [oxidised form] changes the sign of the second term in the equation:

• If the concentration is 1 mol dm−3, log10 [oxidised form] is 0 and E = E⦵.
• If the concentration is less than 1 mol dm−3, log10 [oxidised form] is negative and E is less
positive than E⦵.

• If the concentration is greater than 1 mol dm−3, log10 [oxidised form] is positive and E is more
positive than E⦵.

IMPORTANT
If both oxidised and reduced species in solution have the same concentration, the ratio

1 and since log10(1) = 0, E = E⦵. Note that this applies to any concentration, e.g. 0.05 mol dm−3
oxidised species and 0.05 mol dm−3 reduced species.

Feasibility predictions based on E⦵ don’t always work!

The feasibility of a reaction based on E⦵ values is no guarantee that a reaction will proceed quickly. It only
tells us that a reaction is possible, and that the reverse reaction does not occur. Some reactions are
feasible, but they proceed so slowly that they do not seem to be taking place. Take, for example, the lack
of reactivity of zinc with cold water. Remember that water contains H+ ions. The relevant half-equations
are:
H+(aq) + e− ⇌

H2(g)

Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)

E⦵ = 0.00 V

E⦵ = −0.76 V

Even when the low concentration of H+ ions is taken into account, E⦵ values predict that a reaction should
occur. The rate of reaction between zinc and water, however, is extremely slow. It is the rate of reaction
rather than the value of E⦵ which is determining the lack of reactivity.

Questions
28 A half-cell containing Sn in 1.00 mol dm−3 Sn2+ ions is connected to another half-cell containing Zn in
1.00 mol dm−3 Zn2+ ions.

Sn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Sn(s)

(aq) are changed to 0.1 mol dm−3?
A

−0.062 V

B

+0.62 V

C

−0.90 V

D

−1 V

29 An industrial process relies on a reaction that is impractically slow under normal conditions. How might
you try to solve this problem? Use your knowledge of reaction rates to suggest several different
approaches.

20.7 More about electrolysis
In Section 20.3 we studied the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. During electrolysis:
cations (positive ions) move towards the cathode where they gain electrons; gain of electrons is
reduction
anions (negative ions) move towards the anode where they lose electrons; loss of electrons is
oxidation.
In this section we shall find out how the nature of the electrolyte and the concentration of aqueous
electrolytes affects the products of electrolysis.

Electrolysis of molten electrolytes
When pure molten ionic compounds containing two simple ions are electrolysed, a metal is formed at the
cathode and a non-metal at the anode. Some examples are shown in Table 20.1.
Compound electrolysed

Cathode product

Anode product

aluminium oxide

aluminium

oxygen

magnesium bromide

magnesium

bromine

sodium chloride

sodium

chlorine

zinc iodide

zinc

iodine

Table 20.1: The products formed at the cathode and anode when some molten salts are electrolysed.

Let us take the electrolysis of molten zinc chloride as an example.
At the cathode, the metal ions gain electrons and are reduced to the metal.
Zn2+ + 2e− → Zn
At the anode, the non-metal ions lose electrons and are oxidised to a non-metal.
2Cl− → Cl2 + 2e−

Electrolysis of aqueous solutions
Aqueous solutions of electrolytes contain more than one cation and more than one anion. For example, an
aqueous solution of sodium chloride contains Na+, Cl−, H+ and OH− ions. The H+ and OH− ions arise from
the ionisation of water:
H2O ⇌ H+ + OH−
So, which ions are discharged during the electrolysis of aqueous solutions?
Among other things this depends on:
the relative electrode potential of the ions
the concentration of the ions.

Electrolysis products and electrode potentials
When an aqueous ionic solution is electrolysed using inert electrodes, there is usually only one product
obtained at each electrode. The ease of discharge of cations at the cathode is related to their electrode
potentials. Figure 20.25 shows some half-reactions and their electrode potentials.
The cation that is most easily reduced is discharged at the cathode. So the cation in the half-equation with
the most positive E⦵ value will be discharged.

When a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (1.00 mol dm−3) is electrolysed, H+ ions and
Na+ ions are present in the solution. Hydrogen rather than sodium is formed at the cathode because H+
ions are more easily reduced than Na+ ions.
H+ + e− ⇌

H2

Na+(aq) + e− ⇌ Na(s)

E⦵ = 0.00 V

E⦵ = −2.71 V

IMPORTANT
Remember the three things which decide the product at an electrode:
1 Is the electrolyte molten or an aqueous solution?
2 Are the discharge potentials of the competing ions, e.g. OH− and Cl−, in the electrochemical series
(discharge series) similar or significantly different?
3 Is the concentration of the relevant ions high or low?

Figure 20.25: The ease of discharge of ions at a cathode in electrolysis is related to the electrode potential of the ions.

When a concentrated aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate (1.00 mol dm−3) is electrolysed, H+ ions and
Cu2+ ions are present in the solution. Copper rather than hydrogen is formed at the cathode because Cu2+
ions are more easily reduced than H+ ions.
Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Cu(s)
H+ + e− ⇌

H2

E⦵ = +0.34 V
E⦵ = 0.00 V

At the anode, using platinum electrodes, the ease of discharge of anions follows the order:

When a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium sulfate (1.00 mol dm−3 Na2SO4) is electrolysed, OH− ions
and SO42− ions are present in the solution. Hydroxide ions are discharged at the anode because OH− ions
are more easily oxidised than SO42− ions. The OH− ions are oxidised to oxygen, which bubbles off at the
anode.
4OH−(aq) → O2(g) + 2H2O(l) + 4e−
When a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium iodide (1.00 mol dm−3) is electrolysed, I− ions and OH−
ions are present in the solution. Iodide ions are discharged at the anode because I− ions are more easily
oxidised than OH− ions.
I−(aq) →

I2(aq) + e−

Note that in the discussion above, we have used standard electrode potentials. If conditions are standard,
the concentration of the aqueous solution is 1.00 mol dm−3 with respect to the ionic compound dissolved in
water. But the concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ions in solution is very low. We saw in Section 20.6
that we can use electrode potential values to predict whether or not a reaction will occur under nonstandard conditions. As long as the difference in electrode potentials is greater than 0.30 V, we can be

fairly sure that the predictions will be correct.

32 Predict the electrolysis products at the anode and cathode when the following are electrolysed:

d

molten zinc oxide.

Electrolysis products and solution concentration
When aqueous solutions are electrolysed, the ions are rarely present at concentrations of 1.00 mol dm−3.
In Section 20.6 we saw that the value of E changes with the concentration of the ion. An ion, Z, higher in
the discharge series may be discharged in preference to one below it if Z is present at a relatively higher
concentration than normal. For this to be possible, the E values of the competing ions are usually less than
0.30 V different from each other.
When a concentrated solution of sodium chloride is electrolysed, chloride ions are discharged at the anode
in preference to hydroxide ions. This is because chloride ions are present in a much higher concentration
than hydroxide ions. The chloride ions fall below the hydroxide ions in the discharge series.
But what happens when we electrolyse an extremely dilute solution of sodium chloride?
We find that oxygen, rather than chlorine, is formed at the anode. This is because the relatively lower
concentration of Cl− ions allows OH− ions to fall below Cl− ions in the discharge series. In reality, the
electrolysis of a dilute aqueous solution of sodium chloride gives a mixture of chlorine and oxygen at the
anode. The proportion of oxygen increases, the more dilute the solution.

SUMMARY
During electrolysis, reduction occurs at the cathode (negative electrode) because ions gain electrons from the
cathode and oxidation occurs at the anode (positive electrode) because ions lose electrons to the anode.
A metal is formed at the cathode and a non-metal at the anode when molten metal salts are electrolysed. Hydrogen
may be formed at the cathode and oxygen at the anode when dilute aqueous solutions of metal salts are
electrolysed.
The relationship between the Faraday constant (F), the Avogadro constant (L) and the charge on an electron (E) is
given by F = Le.
The quantity of charge, in coulombs, passed during electrolysis is found by multiplying the current, in amps, by
time, in seconds: Q = It.
A standard hydrogen electrode is a half-cell in which hydrogen gas at a pressure of 101 kPa bubbles through a
solution of 1.00 mol dm−3 H+(aq) ions.
The standard electrode potential of a half-cell (E⦵) is the voltage of the half-cell under standard conditions
compared with a standard hydrogen electrode.

The direction of electron flow in a simple cell is from the half-cell that has the more negative (or less positive)
electrode potential to the half-cell that has the less negative (or more positive) electrode potential.

A particular redox reaction will occur if the E⦵ of the half-equation involving the species being reduced is more
positive than the E⦵ of the half-equation of the species being oxidised.
The Nernst equation shows the relationship between the concentration of aqueous ions in each half-cell and the
electrode potential:

Write down the definition of a Brønsted–Lowry acid and Brønsted–Lowry base. Compare your
definitions with those of another learner.

2

Work with another learner. Take it in turns to explain the meaning of the terms: equilibrium,
equilibrium constant, dissociation, strong acid, strong base, weak acid, weak base, neutralisation. If
you do not agree with each other or are both not sure, check with a textbook or the internet.

with the rest of the class.

4

Get another learner to select a weak acid from Table 21.2. You then both write an equilibrium
expression for this acid. Note that the process is the same as for writing equilibrium expressions for
Kc that you used in Chapter 8. The only difference is you put Ka instead of Kc.

are not sure, check with a textbook or the internet.

GETTING RID OF THE HARDNESS

Figure 21.1: In a hard water area, enough limescale is formed in water pipes, kettles and boilers in your house to fill
a small bucket!

When you add soap solution to a bottle of water and shake it, soap bubbles may form. We say that the
sample of water is ‘soft’. If a greasy solid (scum) forms on the surface of the water and the water looks
milky, we say that the water is ‘hard’ (Figure 21.1). Hard water is caused by dissolved calcium
hydrogencarbonate, magnesium hydrogencarbonate or magnesium sulfate. The scum is an insoluble
compound of calcium or magnesium ions with the long-chain carboxylic acids present in soap.
When hard water is boiled, the soluble hydrogencarbonates change to insoluble carbonates:
Ca(HCO3)2(aq) → CaCO3(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
Carbonates of calcium and magnesium can build up in kettles, boilers and water pipes and cause

many problems. There are several ways of softening hard water. One way is to use an ion-exchange
resin to remove calcium ions. The resin consists of an insoluble polymer which is packed in a column.
The polymer contains negatively charged SO3− groups along its chain. We can represent these as
RSO3−, where R is part of the polymer chain. If we wash the resin with sodium chloride, the sodium
ions are attracted to the SO3− groups. When the ion-exchange resin is connected to the water supply
coming into the house, the calcium or magnesium ions in the hard water are exchanged for the sodium
ions in an equilibrium reaction.
2RSO3−Na+(s) + Ca2+(aq) ⇌ R2(SO3−)2Ca2+(s) + 2Na+(aq)
The position of equilibrium is in favour of the products. So the positive calcium ions form ionic bonds
with the negative charges on the resin and the sodium ions are released. The sodium ions are soluble
in hot water, so no solid is formed on boiling the water.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Work with another learner to make a list of the disadvantages of hard water.
Use textbooks or the internet to find out some other ways of making the water softer.
Use the ion-exchange equation shown above to suggest how you could convert the resin back to its
original form.

21.1 Conjugate acids and conjugate bases
In Chapter 8, we considered acids and bases in terms of the Brønsted–Lowry theory. Acids are proton
donors and bases are proton acceptors.
In a reaction at equilibrium, products are being converted to reactants at the same rate as reactants are
being converted to products. The reverse reaction can also be considered in terms of the Brønsted–Lowry
theory of acids and bases.
Consider the reaction:
NH3(g) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH−(aq)
In the reverse reaction, the NH4+ ion donates a proton to the OH− ion. So NH4+ is acting as an acid and OH
− is acting as a base.

If a reactant is linked to a product by the transfer of a proton we call this pair a conjugate pair. Consider
the following reaction:

Looking at the forward reaction:
Cl− is the conjugate base of the acid HCl
H3O+ is the conjugate acid of the base H2O.
Looking at the reverse reaction:
HCl is the conjugate acid of the base Cl−
H2O is the conjugate base of the acid H3O+.
In a conjugate pair, the acid has one proton more than its conjugate base.
The conjugate pairs for the equilibrium between ammonia and water to form ammonium ions and
hydroxide ions are:

The idea of conjugate acids and bases is sometimes called the acid 1 / base 1, acid 2 / base 2 concept.

b

Identify the acid and the base on the right-hand side of these equilibria.
i

HClO2 + HCOOH ⇌ ClO2− + HCOOH2+

ii

H2S + H2O ⇌ HS− + H3O+

Identify the acid on the right-hand side of this equation which is conjugate with the base on the
left-hand side.
CH3NH2 + H2O ⇌ CH3NH3+ + OH−

The ionic product of water, Kw
Water is able to act as either an acid (by donating protons, H+) or a base (by accepting protons). In pure
water, the following equilibrium exists.

We can simplify this equation by writing hydroxonium ions, H3O+, as simple hydrogen ions, H+:
H2O(l) ⇌ H+(aq) + OH−(aq)
The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:

IMPORTANT
Remember that one use of square brackets is to indicate the concentration of the substance inside the
brackets.
The extent of ionisation of water is very low. The concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in pure
water (and hence the value of Kc) is extremely small. Because of this, we can regard the concentration of
water as being constant.
We can therefore incorporate this into the value of Kc. The equilibrium expression then becomes:
Kw = [H+] [OH−]
Kw is called the ionic product of water. Its value at 298 K is 1.00 × 10−14 mol2 dm−6.
We can use this equation to find the hydrogen ion concentration in pure water; for simplicity we will now
omit the state symbol(aq). For each molecule of water that ionises, one H+ ion and one OH− ion are
produced.
[H+] = [OH−]
We can rewrite the equilibrium expression
Kw = [H+] [OH−]
as:
Kw = [H+]2
Rearranging this equation to find the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in pure water:

21.2 pH calculations

aqueous solutions are shown in Table 21.1.

Table 21.1: pH values of some familiar aqueous solutions.

The range of possible hydrogen ion concentrations in different solutions is very large. It can range from
10−15 mol dm−3 to 10 mol dm−3. In order to overcome the problem of dealing with a wide range of
numbers, the Danish chemist Søren Sørensen introduced the pH scale.
pH is defined as the negative logarithm to base 10 of the hydrogen ion concentration. In symbols this is
written:
pH = –log10 [H+]
Note:
the negative sign is introduced to make the pH values positive in most cases
the logarithms used are to the base 10 (not to the base e), so make sure that when doing calculations,
you press the ‘log’ or ‘lg’ button on your calculator (not the ‘ln’ button)
we can use this equation to convert [H+] to pH or pH to [H+]

Calculating pH values from [H+]
Here is an example of the use of logarithms to calculate pH from hydrogen ion concentrations.
Use your own calculator to check that you can get the correct answer. Try it several times. If you cannot get
this answer (3.27) check with your calculator’s instruction booklet, or find your teacher or a member of
your teaching group to work with to solve this problem.

WORKED EXAMPLE
1

Calculate the pH of a solution whose H+ ion concentration is 5.32 × 10−4 mol dm−3.

Solution

pH = –log10 [H+]
= –log10 (5.32 × 10−4)
= 3.27

Question
2

Calculate the pH of the following solutions:
a

[H+] = 3.00 × 10−4 mol dm−3

b

[H+] = 1.00 × 10−2 mol dm−3

c

[H+] = 4.00 × 10−8 mol dm−3

d

[H+] = 5.40 × 10−12 mol dm−3

e

[H+] = 7.80 × 10−10 mol dm−3

You should notice that the solutions in Question 2, parts c, d and e, are alkalis. They all have pH values
greater than 7. Even though they are alkalis, they each have a small concentration of H+ ions, and this
concentration is used to calculate the pH. They each have a small concentration of H+ ions because H2O ⇌
H+ + OH− is an equilibrium. Even when there is an excess of OH− ions, there is still a small concentration
of H+ ions. In the same way, the solutions in Question 2, parts a and b, have a small concentration of OH−
ions, even though the solutions are acids.

Calculating [H+] from pH
Here is an example of the use of logarithms to calculate hydrogen ion concentration from pH. Use your own
calculator to check that you get the correct answers.

a

pH 2.90

b

pH 3.70

c

pH 11.2

d

pH 5.40

e

pH 12.9

The pH of strong acids
Monobasic acids contain only one replaceable hydrogen atom per molecule. Strong monobasic acids such
as hydrochloric acid are completely ionised in solution. It follows from this that the concentration of
hydrogen ions in solution is approximately the same as the concentration of the acid (Figure 21.2). (We
assume here that the concentration of H+ ions we get from the ionisation of water molecules is very small
compared with the concentration of H+ ions we get from the acid.)

Figure 21.2: A pH electrode allows us to determine pH accurately.

pH of 0.1 mol dm−3 HCl is
–log (1 × 10−1 mol dm−3) = pH 1
pH of 0.01 mol dm−3 HCl is
–log (1 × 10−2 mol dm−3) = pH 2
pH of 0.001 mol dm−3 HCl is
–log (1 × 10−3 mol dm−3) = pH 3

WORKED EXAMPLE
2

Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution whose pH is 10.5.

Solution
pH = –log10 [H+]
[H+] = 10−pH
= 10−10.5
= 3.16 × 10−11 mol dm−3
Use your own calculator to check that you can get the correct answer. Try it several times. If you
cannot get this answer (3.16 × 10−11), check with your calculator’s instruction booklet, or ask your
teacher or a member of your teaching group to work with to solve this problem.

Diluting the acid ten times reduces the value of the H+ ion concentration to one-tenth and increases the pH
by a value of one.

Calculating the pH of strong bases
IMPORTANT
The ionic product for water is given by the equation Kw = [H+] [OH−]. You can rearrange this to
calculate the hydroxide ion concentration if you know Kw and [H+].
Note: You will not be expected to remember anything about the basic dissociation constant Kb.
Strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide, ionise completely in solution. The concentration of hydroxide ions
in a solution of sodium hydroxide is therefore approximately the same as the concentration of the sodium
hydroxide.
To calculate the pH of a solution of strong base we need to know:
the concentration of OH− ions in solution

the equilibrium expression for the ionisation of water:
Kw = [H+] [OH−]
the value of Kw for water.
As Kw = [H+] [OH−]

We can calculate the [H+] and then calculate the pH.

WORKED EXAMPLE
3

Calculate the pH of a solution of sodium hydroxide of concentration 0.0500 mol dm−3.
Kw = 1.00 × 10−14 mol2 dm−6 (at 298 K)

Solution
Step 1:

Write the expression relating [H+] to Kw and [OH−]

Step 2:

Substitute the values into the expression to calculate [H+].

= 2.00 × 10−13 mol dm−3
Step 3:

Calculate the pH.
pH = –log10 [H+]
= –log10 (2.00 × 10−13)
= 12.7
A quick way to get the same answer is to:

• find –log10 [OH−] (here –log10 [OH−] = –log10 (0.0500) = 1.3)
• subtract this value from 14 (in this example 14 – 1.3 = 12.7).
This works because –log10 [H+] – log10 [OH−] = 14.

Question
4

Find the pH of the following strong acids and strong bases:
a

1.00 mol dm−3 HNO3

b

0.500 mol dm−3 HNO3

c

an aqueous solution containing 3.00 g HCl per dm3

d

0.001 00 mol dm−3 KOH (Kw = 1.00 × 10−14 mol2 dm−6)

e

an aqueous solution containing 0.200 g of NaOH per dm3 (Kw = 1.00 × 10−14 mol2 dm−6)

21.3 Weak acids: using the acid dissociation
constant, Ka
Ka and pKa
We can apply the equilibrium law (see Section 8.3) to aqueous solutions of weak acids and weak bases. For
example, when ethanoic acid dissolves in water the following equilibrium results:
CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq)
We can simplify this equation to:

The equilibrium expression for this reaction is:

Ka is called the acid dissociation constant. At 298 K, the value of Ka for the dissociation of ethanoic acid
is 1.74 × 10−5 mol dm−3.
The units of Ka are determined in the same way as for Kc (see Section 8.3). For the dissociation of a
monobasic acid the units are mol dm−3.
We can write the general formula for a monobasic acid as HA. The balanced equation for the partial
ionisation of this weak acid is:
HA(aq) ⇌ H+(aq) + A−(aq)
The general equilibrium expression applying to a monobasic acid then becomes:

Figure 21.3: Friedrich Ostwald (1853–1932) was a German chemist who developed the idea of ‘degree of dissociation’ of
weak acids and bases. He was one of the most well-known physical chemists of his day. But strangely enough, he didn’t
accept the atomic theory until 1906.

The value of Ka indicates the extent of dissociation of the acid (Figure 21.3).
A high value for Ka (for example, 40 mol dm−3) indicates that the position of equilibrium lies to the
right. The acid is almost completely ionised.
A low value for Ka (for example, 1.0 × 10−4 mol dm−3) indicates that the position of equilibrium lies to
the left. The acid is only slightly ionised and exists mainly as HA molecules and comparatively few H+
and A− ions.
As Ka values for many acids are very low, we can use pKa values to compare their strengths.
pKa = –log10Ka
Table 21.2 shows the range of values of Ka and pKa for various acids. Note that the less positive the value
of pKa, the more strongly acidic is the acid.

Calculating Ka for a weak acid
We can calculate the value of Ka for a weak acid if we know:
the concentration of the acid
the pH of the solution.
From the general equation:
HA(aq) ⇌ H+ + A−
we can see that for each molecule of HA that ionises, one H+ ion and one A− ion are produced. (This
assumes that we ignore the H+ ions we get from the ionisation of water.)
[H+] = [A−]
We can rewrite the equilibrium expression

as

In order to calculate the value of Ka we make two assumptions:
We ignore the concentration of hydrogen ions produced by the ionisation of the water molecules
present in the solution. This is reasonable because the ionic product of water (1.00 × 10−14 mol2 dm−6)
is negligible compared with the values for most weak acids (see Table 21.2).
We assume that the ionisation of the weak acid is so small that the concentration of undissociated HA
molecules present at equilibrium is approximately the same as that of the original acid.
Worked example 4 shows how to calculate the value of Ka using the pH and the concentration of the weak
acid.

Calculating the pH of a weak acid
We can calculate the pH value (or [H+]) of a weak acid if we know:
the concentration of the acid
the value of Ka for the acid.
Again, we make the same assumptions about the concentration of hydrogen ions produced by the
ionisation of water and the equilibrium concentration of the weak acid. The value of the pH calculated will
not be significantly affected by these factors unless we require great accuracy (for example, calculating pH
to the third decimal place).
Worked example 5 shows how to calculate pH from the value of Ka and concentration of the weak acid.

21.4 Buffer solutions
What is a buffer solution?
A buffer solution is a solution in which the pH does not change significantly when small amounts of acids
or alkalis are added. A buffer solution is used to keep pH (almost) constant.
A buffer solution is either a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid, which
minimises any change in pH when an acid or alkali is added.
One type of buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid and one of its salts. An example is an aqueous
mixture of ethanoic acid and sodium ethanoate. Mixtures of ethanoic acid and sodium ethanoate in
different proportions act as buffers between pH values of 4 and 7. We can understand how a buffer solution
works by referring to the equilibria involved (Figure 21.4).
Ethanoic acid is a weak acid. So it stays mostly in the un-ionised form (CH3COOH) and only gives rise to a
low concentration of ethanoate ions in solution:

Sodium ethanoate is fully ionised in aqueous solution:

Figure 21.4: The pH of this agar plate for growing bacteria is kept constant by using a buffer solution. The buffer solution
is added into the agar jelly used to make the plate.

The buffer solution contains relatively high concentrations of both CH3COOH and CH3COO−. We say that
there are reserve supplies of the acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO−). The pH of a buffer
solution depends on the ratio of the concentration of the acid and the concentration of its conjugate base.
If this does not change very much, the pH changes very little.
In the buffer solution ethanoic acid molecules are in equilibrium with hydrogen ions and ethanoate ions:

We can use this equation to explain how buffer solutions work.
An increase in hydrogen ion concentration would greatly lower the pH of water, but when H+ ions are
added to the buffer solution:
addition of H+ ions shifts the position of equilibrium to the left because H+ ions combine with CH3COO−
ions to form more CH3COOH until equilibrium is re-established
the large reserve supply of CH3COO− ensures that the concentration of CH3COO− ions in solution does
not change significantly
the large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the concentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution
does not change significantly

so the pH does not change significantly.
An increase in hydroxide ion concentration would greatly increase the pH of water, but when OH− ions are
added to the buffer solution:
the added OH− ions combine with H+ ions to form water
this reduces the H+ ion concentration
the position of equilibrium shifts to the right
so CH3COOH molecules ionise to form more H+ and CH3COO− ions until equilibrium is re-established
the large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the concentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution
does not change significantly
the large reserve supply of CH3COO− ensures that the concentration of CH3COO− ions in solution does
not change significantly
so the pH does not change significantly.
In unpolluted regions of the Earth, rainwater has a pH of 5.7. This is because carbon dioxide dissolves in
the rainwater to form a dilute solution of the weak acid carbonic acid, H2CO3. This acid and its conjugate
base, HCO3−, act as a buffer solution. It minimises changes in pH if very small amounts of acid or alkali are
added to the rainwater. But in regions where there is pollution caused by the emission of acidic oxides of
nitrogen and sulfur, the pH of the rainwater falls to around 4. The rainwater can no longer act as a buffer
because the concentrations of the H2CO3 and HCO3− are not high enough to cope with the large amounts
of acidic pollution involved.
No buffer solution can cope with the excessive addition of acids or alkalis. If very large amounts of acid or
alkali are added, the pH will change significantly.
Buffer solutions that resist changes in pH in alkaline regions are usually a mixture of a weak base and its
conjugate acid. An example is a mixture of aqueous ammonia with ammonium chloride.
Aqueous ammonia is a weak base, so there is only a low concentration of ammonium ions in ammonia
solution:
NH3(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH−(aq)
Ammonium chloride is fully ionised in aqueous solution. This supplies the reserve supplies of the conjugate
acid, NH4+.
NH4Cl(aq) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + Cl−(aq)

b

Calculating the pH of a buffer solution
We can calculate the pH of a buffer solution if we know:
the Ka of the weak acid
the equilibrium concentration of the weak acid and its conjugate base (salt).
To do the calculation, we use the equilibrium expression for the particular reaction.
We can make the numbers easier to deal with in calculations involving buffer solutions by using logarithms
throughout. So instead of using the expression:

we can use the expression:

IMPORTANT
Remember that in the expression

for the buffer solution
HCOOH ⇌ HCOO− + H+
the salt contains the HCOO−
HCOO− and HCOOH are a conjugate pair.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 21.1
Making a buffer solution
We make buffer solutions by adding a solution of a weak acid to its conjugate base or a weak base to
its conjugate acid until we get the pH that is required. The more concentrated the acid and conjugate
base, the more effective is the buffer solution at preventing a change in pH.
1 Put 50 cm3 of 0.1 mol dm−3 ethanoic acid in a small beaker.
2 Add a spatula-ful of sodium ethanoate and stir with a glass rod until the sodium ethanoate
dissolves.
3 Add a few drops of universal indicator solution to give a definite colour and determine the pH using
the indicator colour chart. (Alternatively, use a pH meter.)
4 Label the beaker ‘buffer solution’.
5 To a second beaker add 1 drop of 1.0 mol dm−3 hydrochloric acid and 50 cm3 distilled water.
6 Add a few drops of universal indicator solution and then dilute the solution very gradually with more
distilled water until you get the same pH as the pH of the buffer solution. You may need to add
more indicator to get the same colour intensity as the buffer solution.
7 Label the beaker ‘unbuffered solution’.
8 Add one drop of 0.1 mol dm−3 sodium hydroxide to each of the beakers. Observe what happens.
Add a further drop of sodium hydroxide one at a time, to each of the beakers. Which solution is best
at resisting pH change?

Uses of buffer solutions
Buffer solutions play an important part in many industrial processes, including electroplating, the
manufacture of dyes and in the treatment of leather. They are also used to make sure that pH meters
record the correct pH.
Many animals depend on buffers to keep a constant pH in various parts of their bodies. In humans, the pH
of the blood is kept between 7.35 and 7.45 by a number of different buffers in the blood:
hydrogencarbonate ions, HCO3−
haemoglobin and plasma proteins
dihydrogenphosphate (H2PO4−) and hydrogenphosphate (HPO42−) ions.
The pH of the blood is often checked by doctors as it can give information which helps identify problems in

the workings of the body (Figure 21.5).
The cells in our body produce carbon dioxide as a product of aerobic respiration (the oxidation of glucose to
provide energy). Carbon dioxide combines with water in the blood to form a solution containing hydrogen
ions.
CO2(aq) + H2O(aq) ⇌ H+(aq) + HCO3−(aq)
hydrogencarbonate ion

This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. When the blood passes through the small
blood vessels around our lungs, hydrogencarbonate ions are rapidly converted to carbon dioxide and water.
The carbon dioxide escapes into the lungs.
The production of H+ ions, if left unchecked, would lower the pH of the blood and cause ‘acidosis’. This may
disrupt some body functions and eventually lead to coma. The equilibrium between carbon dioxide and
hydrogencarbonate is the most important buffering system in the blood.
If the H+ ion concentration increases:
the position of this equilibrium shifts to the left
H+ ions combine with HCO3− ions to form carbon dioxide and water until equilibrium is restored
this reduces the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood and helps keep the pH constant.
If the H+ ion concentration decreases:
the position of this equilibrium shifts to the right
some carbon dioxide and water combine to form H+ and HCO3− ions until equilibrium is restored
this increases the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood and helps keep the pH constant.

Figure 21.5: Anaesthetists monitor the pH of a patient’s blood.

21.5 Equilibrium and solubility
In Chapter 4 we learned that most ionic compounds dissolve in water. In Chapter 19 we related solubility to
enthalpy change of solution. Some ionic compounds, however, are insoluble or only slightly soluble in
water. But even ‘insoluble’ ionic compounds may dissolve to a very small extent in water. Solubility is
generally quoted as the number of grams or number of moles of compound needed to saturate 100 g or 1
kg of water at a given temperature. We say that a solution is saturated when no more solute dissolves in it.
Sodium chloride is regarded as a soluble salt: a saturated solution contains 36 g per 100 g of water.
Lead(II) chloride is regarded as an insoluble salt: a saturated solution contains 0.99 g per 100 g of
water.

Solubility product
An equilibrium is established when an undissolved ionic compound is in contact with a saturated solution of
its ions. The ions move from the solid to the saturated solution at the same rate as they move from the
solution to the solid (Figure 21.6).

Figure 21.6: An equilibrium is established between solid silver chloride and its saturated solution. The water molecules
are not shown.

When solid silver chloride dissolves, it is in contact with saturated silver chloride solution and the following
equilibrium is set up:
AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
The equilibrium expression relating to this equation is:

For any solid, the concentration of the solid phase remains constant and can be combined with the value of
Kc.
So we can write this equilibrium expression as:
Ksp = [Ag+(aq)] [Cl−(aq)]
Ksp is called the solubility product. Values are quoted at 298 K.
Ksp = [Cy+(aq)]a [Ax−(aq)]b
where a is the number of Cy+ cations in one formula unit of the compound and b is the number of Ax−
anions in one formula unit of the compound.
So for Fe2S3 (which contains Fe3+ ions and S2− ions) the equilibrium is:
Fe2S3(s) ⇌ 2Fe3+(aq) + 3S2−(aq)
and the equilibrium expression is:
Ksp = [Fe3+(aq)]2 [S2−(aq)]3
The idea of solubility product only applies to ionic compounds that are slightly soluble.
The units of solubility product depend on the number of each type of ion present in solution. You can work

the units out in the same way as for general equilibrium expressions (see Section 8.3), but you don’t have
to do any cancelling. For example, for the expression:
Ksp = [Mg2+(aq)] × [OH−(aq)]2
= mol dm−3 × (mol dm−3)2
= mol3 dm−9
The idea of solubility product is only useful for sparingly soluble salts. The smaller the value of Ksp the
lower is the solubility of the salt. Some values of Ksp are given in Table 21.3.

to calculate the solubility of a compound from its solubility product. An example of each of these types of
calculation is shown in Worked examples 7 and 8.

WORKED EXAMPLES

7

Calculating solubility product from solubility.
A saturated solution of magnesium fluoride, MgF2, has a solubility of 1.22 × 10−3 mol dm−3.
Calculate the solubility product of magnesium fluoride.

Solution
Step 1:

Write down the equilibrium equation.
MgF2(s) ⇌ Mg2+(aq) + 2F−(aq)

Step 2:

Calculate the concentration of each ion in solution.
When 1.22 × 10−3 mol dissolves to form 1 dm3 of solution the concentration of each ion
is:
[Mg2+] = 1.22 × 10−3 mol dm−3
[F−] = 2 × 1.22 × 10−3 mol dm−3
= 2.44 × 10−3 mol dm−3
(The concentration of F− is 2 × 1.22 × 10−3 mol dm−3 because each formula unit
contains 2 × F− ions.)

Step 3:

Write down the equilibrium expression.
Ksp = [Mg2+] [F−]2

Step 4:

Substitute the values.
Ksp = (1.22 × 10−3) × (2.44 × 10−3)2
= 7.26 × 10−9

Step 5:

Add the correct units.
(mol dm−3) × (mol dm−3)2 = mol3 dm−9
Answer = 7.26 × 10−9 mol3 dm−9

CuS(s) ⇌ Cu2+(aq) + S2−(aq)

Step 2:

Write the equilibrium expression in terms of one ion only.
From the equilibrium equation
[Cu2+] = [S2−]
So Ksp = [Cu2+] [S2−] becomes Ksp = [Cu2+]2

Step 3:

Substitute the value of Ksp.
(6.3 × 10−36) = [Cu2+]2

Calculate the concentration.
In this case we take the square root of Ksp.

Calculate the solubility of silver carbonate, Ag2CO3.
(Ksp = 6.3 × 10−12 mol3 dm−9)
Tip: you have to divide by 4, then take the cube root. Can you see why? You should have a cube
root button on your calculator ( ).

Predicting precipitation
We can use the solubility product to predict whether precipitation will occur when two solutions are mixed.
For example, will we get a precipitate when we mix a solution of barium chloride, BaCl2, with a very dilute
solution of sodium carbonate?
Both barium chloride and sodium carbonate are soluble salts, but barium carbonate is relatively insoluble.
We must consider the equilibrium for the insoluble salt dissolving in water:
BaCO3(s) ⇌ Ba2+(aq) + CO32−(aq)
The solubility product is given by:
Ksp = [Ba2+] [CO32−] = 5.5 × 10−10 mol2 dm−6
If [Ba2+] [CO32−] is greater than 5.5 × 10−10 mol2 dm−6 a precipitate will form.
If [Ba2+] [CO32−] is less than 5.5 × 10−10 mol2 dm−6 no precipitate will form (see worked example 9).

IMPORTANT
Remember that solubility product is only relevant for salts which are sparingly (very slightly) soluble.
The concept cannot be used for soluble salts such as sodium chloride. Remember that soluble salts
include salts of Group I elements, all nitrates and ammonium salts and many sulfates. Halides are
generally soluble except for lead(II) halides and silver halides.

The common ion effect
The common ion effect is the reduction in the solubility of a dissolved salt achieved by adding a solution
of a compound that has an ion in common with the dissolved salt. This often results in precipitation (Figure
21.7).

Figure 21.7: The shell of this nautilus is composed mainly of calcium carbonate. The nautilus adjusts conditions so shell
material is formed when the concentration of calcium ions and carbonate ions in seawater are high enough to precipitate
calcium carbonate.

An example of the common ion effect can be seen when we add a solution of sodium chloride to a
saturated solution of silver chloride and silver chloride precipitates. Why is this?

WORKED EXAMPLES
9

Will a precipitate form if we mix equal volumes of solutions of 1.00 × 10−4 mol dm−3 Na2CO3 and
5.00 × 10−5 mol dm−3 BaCl2?

Solution
[CO32−] = 5.00 × 10−5 mol dm−3
[Ba2+] = 2.50 × 10−5 mol dm−3
[Ba2+] [CO32−] = (2.50 × 10−5) × (5.00 × 10−5)
= 1.25 × 10−9 mol2 dm−6
This value is greater than the solubility product, so a precipitate of barium carbonate forms.

In a saturated solution of silver chloride in water, we have the following equilibrium:
AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
We now add a solution of sodium chloride:
the chloride ion is common to both sodium chloride and silver chloride
the added chloride ions shift the position of equilibrium to the left
silver chloride is precipitated.
The addition of the common ion, Cl−, has reduced the solubility of the silver chloride because its solubility
product has been exceeded. When [Ag+] [Cl−] is greater than the Ksp for silver chloride, a precipitate will
form.
The solubility of an ionic compound in aqueous solution containing a common ion is less than its solubility
in water.
For example, the solubility of barium sulfate, BaSO4, in water is 1.0 × 10−5 mol dm−3 and the solubility of
barium sulfate in 0.100 mol dm−3 sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is only 1.0 × 10−9 mol dm−3.
We can explain the lower solubility in sulfuric acid by referring to the solubility product of barium sulfate:

Ksp = [Ba2+] [SO42−] = 1.0 × 10−10 mol2 dm−6
If we ignore the very small amount of SO42−(aq) from the barium sulfate then [SO42−] is 0.1 mol dm−3
(from the sulfuric acid). This gives:
1.0 × 10−10 = [Ba2+] × [0.1]
[Ba2+] = 1.0 × 10−9 mol dm−3

21.6 Partition coefficients
The principle of partition of a solute between two solvents helps us to understand more fully how we
separate the components in a mixture in chromatography (see Section 30.1). Let us consider ammonia
dissolved in two immiscible solvents. Immiscible solvents are solvents that do not dissolve in each other
and so form two separate layers (Figure 21.8).

Figure 21.8: Ammonia (the solute) dissolves in both the solvents, water and the organic solvent. A state of dynamic
equilibrium is established.

A separating funnel is shaken with the organic solvent and an aqueous solution of ammonia. The ammonia
is soluble in both solvents so when the mixture is left to settle, a dynamic equilibrium is established. At this
point, ammonia molecules are moving from the aqueous layer to the organic layer at the same rate as they
are moving from the organic layer to the aqueous layer:
NH3(aq) ⇌ NH3(organic solvent)
We can calculate a value for the equilibrium constant (see Section 8.3). We call this the partition
coefficient, Kpc. The partition coefficient is the equilibrium constant that relates the concentration of a
solute partitioned between two immiscible solvents at a particular temperature.

WORKED EXAMPLES
10 100 cm3 of a 0.100 mol dm−3 solution of ammonia in water at 20 °C was shaken with 50 cm3 of an
organic solvent and left in a separating funnel for equilibrium to be established.
A 20.0 cm3 portion of the aqueous layer was run off and titrated against 0.200 mol dm−3 dilute
hydrochloric acid. The end-point was found to be 9.40 cm3 of acid.
What is the partition coefficient of ammonia between these two solvents at 20 °C?

Solution
The alkaline ammonia solution is neutralised by dilute hydrochloric acid:
NH3(aq) + HCl(aq) → NH4Cl(aq)
1 mole of ammonia reacts with 1 mole of the acid. In the titration we used:
× 0.200 moles of HCl
= 1.88 × 10−3 moles
This reacts with ammonia in the ratio 1 : 1 so there must be 1.88 × 10−3 moles of NH3 in the 20.0
cm3 portion titrated.
Therefore, in the 100 cm3 aqueous layer there are

1.88 × 10−3 ×

mol

= 9.40 × 10−3 mol
The number of moles of ammonia in the organic layer must be equal to the initial number of moles
of ammonia minus the amount left in the aqueous layer at equilibrium.

• initial number of moles of ammonia
= 0.100 ×

= 0.0100 mol

• final number of moles of ammonia in organic layer
= 0.0100 – 9.40 × 10−3 mol
= 6.00 × 10−4 mol
Now we need to change the numbers of moles of ammonia in each layer into concentrations (i.e. the
number of moles in 1000 cm3 or 1 dm3) to substitute into the equilibrium expression for the partition
coefficient, Kpc.

• concentration of ammonia in 100 cm3 of the aqueous layer
= 9.40 × 10−3 ×
= 0.094 mol dm−3

• concentration of ammonia in 50 cm3 of the organic solvent
= 6.00 × 10−4 ×
= 0.012 mol dm−3
The expression for the partition coefficient, Kpc is:

• This value is less than 1, which shows us that ammonia is more soluble in water than in the
organic solvent.

What affects the value of Kpc?
The value of Kpc depends on the relative solubilities of the solute in the two solvents used in the
partitioning. Solubility depends on the strength of the intermolecular bonds between the solute and the
solvent. This in turn depends on the polarity of the molecules of solute and solvent. For example, ammonia
is a polar molecule that forms hydrogen bonds with water. So ammonia is very soluble in water. Ammonia
is less soluble in organic solvents such as trichloromethane (CHCl3) because the bonding between
ammonia and the solvent is permanent dipole–permanent dipole, which is weaker than hydrogen bonding.
So the partition coefficient:

is less than 1 because the concentration of ammonia in CHCl3 is less than the concentration of ammonia in
water.
Iodine is a molecular element and will not dissolve very well in water. In order for it to dissolve, iodine–
water bonds need to be formed. This is unlikely because the hydrogen bonding between water molecules is
one of the strongest intermolecular forces. The iodine cannot disrupt the hydrogen bonded structure of
water. Iodine dissolves in organic solvents such as cyclohexane. Both are non-polar molecules. Iodine forms
instantaneous dipole–induced dipole bonds with cyclohexane.

IMPORTANT
Iodine does appear to dissolve in water to a very small extent. This is due to the equilibrium
I2 + H2O ⇌ IO− + I− + 2H+
The position of equilibrium is well over to the left. The iodine itself is not soluble but the ions formed

are and so the iodine appears to dissolve very slightly. Note that solutions of iodine in the laboratory
are made up by dissolving iodine in potassium iodide. The ion I3− is formed, which is soluble in water.
So iodine is more soluble in organic solvents than in water and the partition coefficient:

is greater than 1 because the concentration of iodine in C6H12 is greater than the concentration of iodine in
water.
In general, for a solute X partitioned between two solvents, A and B, the equilibrium expression is given by:

The solute X should be in the same physical state and molecular state in both solvents, e.g. in Worked
example 10, ammonia is present as NH3 in solution.

Partition coefficients and paper chromatography
In paper chromatography, the different partition coefficients of the components in a mixture correspond to
their relative solubilities in the two solvents. In Worked example 10, the relative solubility of ammonia in
water is greater than in the organic solvent. In paper chromatography, the mobile phase is the solvent
chosen. The other solvent is the water trapped in the paper’s structure, which is the stationary phase.
Figure 21.9 shows solute molecules partitioned between the mobile phase and a stationary liquid phase on
a solid support.

Figure 21.9: Partition chromatography. The mobile phase moves over the stationary liquid phase, carrying solute
particles with it. The filter paper is the solid support in paper chromatography.

The solutes in the mixture being separated are partitioned to different extents between the solvents in the
mobile and stationary phases. The greater the relative solubility in the mobile phase, the faster the rate of
movement as the mobile phase passes over the stationary phase.

SUMMARY
pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration: pH = –log10 [H+(aq)]
Ka is the dissociation constant for an acid. It is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of a weak acid,

Acid strengths can be compared using pKa values: pKa = –log10Ka
The ionic product for water, Kw = [H+(aq)] [OH−(aq)] = 1.00 × 10−14 mol2 dm−6
A buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.
The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated by using the equilibrium concentrations of the weak acid and its
conjugate base and the Ka value of the weak acid.
The solubility product, Ksp, is the equilibrium expression showing the equilibrium concentrations of the ions in a
saturated solution of a sparingly soluble salt taking into account the relative number of each ion present.
The addition of a common ion to a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble salt (e.g. adding a concentrated solution
of (sodium) chloride to a saturated solution of silver chloride) causes precipitation of the sparingly soluble salt.
The partition coefficient, Kpc, is the equilibrium constant which relates the concentration of a solute partitioned
between two immiscible solvents at a particular temperature.

reaction
CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + H2O + CO2

STUDYING VERY FAST REACTIONS
Fifty years ago, chemists were becoming excited about monitoring very fast reactions in milliseconds.
The complete course of some very fast reactions can be monitored using stopped-flow
spectrophotometry. In this technique, very small volumes of reactants are driven at high speed into a
mixing chamber. From here they go to an observation cell, where the progress of the reaction is
monitored (usually by measuring the transmission of ultraviolet radiation through the sample). A graph
of rate of reaction against time can be generated automatically.
At the same time, physicists were developing and experimenting with lasers that produce a beam of
radiation of a single wavelength and produce pulses of radiation which last only a few picoseconds (1
picosecond = 10−12 s) (Figure 22.1). This led to the possibility of studying even faster light-dependent
reactions that involve the formation of free radicals, e.g. the reaction of chlorine with methane in the
presence of light.

Figure 22.1: Lasers such as this can be used to study how molecules break apart and rearrange themselves.

In order to investigate a light-dependent reaction, the laser light is separated into two pulses. We can
use the time delay between the pulses to get information about the reaction. One of the first uses of
this new technology by chemists was to investigate the dissociation of iodine molecules dissolved in a
solution of tetrachloromethane. After the first pulse of light, it takes 50 picoseconds for the iodine
molecules to dissociate (break up) into iodine atoms. The iodine atoms then recombine to form iodine
molecules. The rate of recombination of the iodine atoms into iodine molecules was lower than
predicted. This led the scientists to suggest that a solvent cage of tetrachloromethane around the
iodine was reducing the rate of the reaction. Some iodine atoms were escaping from the solvent cage
but the molecules did not. Carrying out the experiment with higher frequency (higher energy) light
increased this difference. The scientists suggested that more iodine atoms escaped from the solvent
cage because more iodine atoms were formed.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
Sketch a graph of the laser experiment to show the change in absorption (y-axis) of the iodine with
time. Assume that the absorption is proportional to the number of iodine atoms in the mixture.
Suggest why the results of the experiment were controversial at the time.
To what extent do chemists depend on physicists and mathematicians?

22.1 Factors affecting reaction rate
In Chapter 9 you learned why reaction rate is increased when:
the concentrations of the reactants are increased
the temperature is increased
a catalyst is added to the reaction mixture.
In this chapter you will review the definition of the rate of reaction, and find out about:
quantitative aspects of reaction rates
how the data gathered from experiments on rates of reaction can be used to confirm possible reaction
mechanisms
more about how catalysts speed up reaction rates.

22.2 Rate of reaction
Defining rate of reaction
We calculate rate of reaction by measuring a decrease in concentration of a particular reactant or an
increase in concentration of a particular product over a period of time.

Units of concentration are usually expressed in mol dm−3, units of time are usually expressed in seconds,
so the units of rate of reaction are normally mol dm−3 s−1. For very slow reactions, you may see the units
of rates expressed as mol dm−3 min−1 or mol dm−3 h−1.
In Chapter 9 we showed how the rate of reaction can be calculated by using tangents to the curve. In this
chapter we will analyse the shape of the curves obtained in greater depth and show how the information
obtained from experiments on rate of reaction can be used to give information consistent with a proposed
reaction mechanism.

22.3 Rate equations
The rate constant and rate equations
The units of rate of reaction are mol dm−3 s−1.
In Chapter 9 we studied the rate of isomerisation of cyclopropane to propene.

The progress of this reaction can be followed by measuring the decrease in concentration of cyclopropane
or increase in concentration of propene. Table 22.1 shows the change of cyclopropane concentration at 500
°C. The measurements were all made at the same temperature because reaction rate is affected markedly
by temperature.

Table 22.1: Rates of conversion of cyclopropane to propene at different concentrations of cyclopropane.

A graph of rate of reaction against concentration of cyclopropane (Figure 22.2) shows us that the rate is
directly proportional to the concentration of cyclopropane. So, if the concentration of cyclopropane is
doubled, the rate of reaction is doubled. If the concentration of cyclopropane falls by one-third, the rate of
reaction falls by one-third.

Figure 22.2: The rate of decrease of cyclopropane. Note how the gradient

is constant.

The third column in Table 22.1 shows that the rate of the reaction is proportional to cyclopropane
concentration (within the limits of experimental error). This is shown by the fact that the rate divided by
concentration is constant.
We can express this mathematically as:
rate of reaction = k × [cyclopropane]

The proportionality constant, k, is called the rate constant.
The overall expression (rate of reaction = k × [cyclopropane]) is the rate equation for this particular
reaction. Rate equations are generally written without the × sign.
For example:
rate = k[cyclopropane]
Rate equations can only be determined from experimental data. They cannot be found from the
stoichiometric equation.
Some experimentally determined rate equations are shown in Table 22.2.
Reaction number

Stoichiometric equation

H2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g)

rate = k[H2] [I2]

2

NO(g) + CO(g) + O2(g) → NO2(g) + CO2(g)

rate = k[NO]2

3

2H2(g) + 2NO(g) → 2H2O(g) + N2(g)

rate = k[H2] [NO]2

4

BrO3−(aq) + 5Br−(aq) + H+(aq) → 3Br2(aq) + 3H2O(l)

rate = k[BrO3−] [Br−] [H+]2

Table 22.2: Rate equations for some reactions.

You can see from reaction 1 that the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of both H2 and I2;
however, in reaction 2, CO and O2 do not appear in the rate equation, even though they are present in the
stoichiometric equation. Similarly in reactions 3 and 4 there is no relationship between the rate equation
and the stoichiometry of the chemical equation.
In order to find the rate equation, we have to conduct a series of experiments. Using reaction 3 from Table
22.2 as an example:
First, find how the concentration of H2(g) affects the rate by varying the concentration of H2(g), while
keeping the concentration of NO(g) constant.
The results show that the rate is proportional to the concentration of hydrogen (rate = k1[H2])
Then find how the concentration of NO(g) affects the rate by varying the concentration of NO(g) while
keeping the concentration of H2(g) constant.
The results show that the rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of NO (rate = k2[NO]2).
Combining the two rate equations we get the overall rate equation:
rate = k[H2] [NO]2
The rate equations for some reactions may include compounds that are not present in the chemical
equation.

Question
1

Write rate equations for each of the following reactions:
a

cyclopropane → propene
where rate is proportional to the concentration of cyclopropane

b

2HI(g) → H2(g) + I2(g)
where rate is proportional to the square of the hydrogen iodide concentration

c

C12H22O11(g) + H2O(l)

2C6H12O6(aq)

where rate is proportional to the concentration of C12H22O11 and to the concentration of H+ ions
d

2HgCl2(aq) + K2C2O4(aq) → Hg2Cl2(s) + 2KCl(aq) + 2CO2(g)
where rate is proportional to the concentration of HgCl2 and to the square of the concentration of

K2C 2O 4
e

CH3COCH3 + I2

CH3COCH2I + HI

where rate is proportional to the concentration of CH3COCH3 and to the concentration of H+ ions,
but the concentration of I2 has no effect on the rate.

Order of reaction
The order of a reaction shows how the concentration of a reactant affects the rate of reaction.
The order of reaction with respect to a particular reactant is the power to which the concentration of that
reactant is raised in the rate equation.
For example, for a rate equation involving only one particular reactant, the order is the power of the
concentration shown in the rate equation. For reaction 2 in Table 22.2, the rate equation is rate = k[NO]2
and so the order is 2 with respect to [NO].
When you are writing about order of reaction, you must distinguish carefully between the order with
respect to a particular reactant and the overall order of reaction. Taking reaction 3 in Table 22.2 as an
example:
rate = k[H2] [NO]2
We say that this reaction is:
first order with respect to H2 (as rate is proportional to [H2]1)
second order with respect to NO (as rate is proportional to [NO]2)
third order overall (as the sum of the powers is 1 + 2 = 3).
In general terms, for a reaction A + B → products, the rate equation can be written in the form:
rate of reaction = k[A]m[B]n
In this equation:
[A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants
m and n are the orders of the reaction
the values of m and n can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or rarely higher
when the value of m or n is 0 we can ignore the concentration term because any number to the power
of zero = 1.
Orders of reaction are not always whole numbers. A few reactions have fractional orders. For example, the
reaction:
CH3CHO(g) → CH4(g) + CO(g)
has an overall order of 1.5. The rate equation for this reaction is:
rate = k[CH3CHO]1.5
Many reactions involving free radicals have fractional orders of reaction.

IMPORTANT
When discussing order of reaction, make sure that you state what the order refers to, e.g. first order
with respect to hydrogen; second order overall.

Question
2

For each of the reactions a to e in Question 1, state:
i

the order of reaction with respect to each reactant

ii

the overall order of reaction.

Units of k
The units of k vary according to the form of the rate equation.

IMPORTANT
Remember that the units of rate are usually mol dm−3 but the units of the rate constant must be
worked out from the rate equation in the form

Question

a

rate = k[NO]2

22.4 Which order of reaction?
We can identify the order of a reaction in three ways:
plot a graph of reaction rate against concentration of reactant
plot a graph of concentration of reactant against time
deduce successive half-lives from graphs of concentration against time.

Graphs of reaction rate against concentration
A graph of reaction rate against concentration tells us whether a reaction is zero, first, second or third
order with respect to a particular reactant (or overall). It is very rare to obtain an order with respect to a
particular reactant higher than second order. Figure 22.3 shows the shapes of the graphs expected for
different orders of reaction.

Figure 22.3: Zero-, first- and second-order reactions: how changes in the concentration of a reactant affect the reaction
rate.

We shall now look at some examples of zero-, first- and second-order reactions.

Zero-order reaction
2NH3(g)

N2(g) + 3H2(g)

The rate equation derived from experiments is:
rate = k[NH3]0
The plot of reaction rate against concentration is a horizontal straight line (see Figure 22.3). The reaction
rate does not change with concentration. For a zero-order reaction, k is numerically equal to the reaction
rate:
rate = k
This is because any number to the power of zero = 1.

First-order reaction
2N2O(g)

2N2(g) + O2(g)

The rate equation derived from experiments is:

rate = k[N2O]1
This is usually written as:
rate = k[N2O]
The plot of reaction rate against concentration is an inclined straight line going through the origin (see
Figure 22.3). The rate is directly proportional to the concentration of N2O. So doubling the concentration of
N2O doubles the rate of reaction.

Second-order reaction
NO2(g) + CO(g) → NO(g) + CO2(g)
The rate equation derived from experiments is:
rate = k[NO2]2
The plot of reaction rate against concentration is an upwardly curved line (see Figure 22.3).
In this case, reaction rate is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of NO2(g). When the
concentration of NO2(g) doubles, the rate of reaction increases four-fold. If we consider the second-order
rate equation as written above, we can see that this is true by comparing the rates at two different
concentrations, 1 mol dm−3 and 2 mol dm−3.
rate at 1 mol dm−3 = k(1)2 = 1k
rate at 2 mol dm−3 = k(2)2 = 4k

Question
4

Draw sketch graphs of reaction rate against concentration of the reactant in bold for each of the
following reactions:
a

NO(g) + CO(g) + O2(g) → NO2(g) + CO2(g)
for which the rate equation is: rate = k[NO]2

b

2HI(g)

H2(g) + I2(g)

for which the rate equation is: rate = k
Note: the catalyst influences the order here: the order is not the same as for the uncatalysed
reaction.
c

(CH3)3CCl + OH− → (CH3)3COH + Cl−
for which the rate equation is: k[(CH3)3CCl]

Graphs of concentration of reactant against time
Figure 22.4 shows how we can distinguish between zero-, first- and second-order reactions by plotting a
graph of concentration against time.
For a zero-order reaction, the graph is a descending straight line. The rate of reaction is the slope
(gradient) of the graph. The reaction proceeds at the same rate whatever the concentration of the
reactant.

Figure 22.4: Zero-, first- and second-order reactions: how changes in the concentration of a reactant affect the time
taken for a reaction to proceed.

For first- and second-order reactions, the graph is a curve. The curve for the second-order reaction is much
deeper than for a first-order reaction. It also appears to have a relatively longer ‘tail’ as it levels off. We can
also distinguish between these two curves by determining successive half-lives of the reaction.

Question
5

For each of the reactions a to c in Question 4, draw a sketch graph to show how the concentration of
the bold reactant changes with time.

Half-life and reaction rates
Half-life,

, is the time taken for the concentration of a limiting reactant to fall to half of its initial

value.
Figure 22.5 shows how half-life is measured for the cyclopropane to propene reaction that we studied
earlier. Three successive half-lives are shown. Table 22.3 shows the values of the successive half-lives
obtained from Figure 22.5.
Δ[cyclopropane] / mol dm−3

Half-life / min

4.00 to 2.00

17.0

2.00 to 1.00

34.3 – 17.0 = 17.3

1.00 to 0.50

51.0 – 34.3 = 16.7

Table 22.3: A constant half-life indicates a first-order reaction.

Figure 22.5: Measurement of half-life for cyclopropane isomerisation.

You can see that the successive half-lives have values that are fairly close to each other (17.0, 17.3, 16.7).
The mean half-life is 17.0 minutes for this reaction. We can tell that this reaction is first order because the
successive half-lives are more or less constant. In a first-order reaction like this, the half-life is independent
of the original concentration of reactant. This means that whatever the starting concentration of
cyclopropane, the half-life will always be 17 minutes.
We can distinguish zero-, first- and second-order reactions from their successive half-lives (Figure 22.6).

Figure 22.6: The half-life of zero-, first- and second-order reactions can be determined from graphs of concentration
against time.

A zero-order reaction has successive half-lives which decrease with time.
A first-order reaction has a half-life which is constant.
Second-order reactions have successive half-lives which increase with time. (This also applies to
reactions with a higher order for a particular reactant but we will not be discussing these.)

IMPORTANT
For the half-life method, you will only be expected to do calculations for first-order reactions.

22.5 Calculations involving the rate constant, k
Calculating k from initial concentrations and initial rate
In the presence of hydrogen ions, hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, reacts with iodide ions to form water and
iodine:
H2O2(aq) + 2I−(aq) + 2H+(aq) → 2H2O(l) + I2(aq)
The rate equation for this reaction is:
rate of reaction = k[H2O2] [I−]
The progress of the reaction can be followed by measuring the initial rate of formation of iodine. Table 22.4
shows the rates of reaction obtained using various initial concentrations of each reactant.

The procedure for calculating k is shown below, using the data for experiment 1.
Step 1: Write out the rate equation.
rate of reaction = k[H2O2] [I−]
Step 2: Rearrange the equation in terms of k

Step 3: Substitute the values
k=
k = 1.75 × 10−2 dm3 mol−1 s−1
Note: the concentration of hydrogen ions is ignored because [H+] does not appear in the rate equation. The
reaction is zero order with respect to [H+].

Calculating k from half-life
For a first-order reaction, half-life is related to the rate constant by the expression:
, where

is the half-life, measured in s.

We can rewrite this in the form:

So, for the first-order reaction cyclopropane to propene, for which the half-life is 17.0 min, we:
convert minutes to seconds
then substitute the half-life into the expression:
t = 0.693
k=
= 6.79 × 10−4 dm3 mol−1 s−1

This value is very close to the ones quoted in Table 22.1. Rate constants for zero- and second-order
reactions can also be calculated from half-lives but the calculations are more complex.
We can also use the expression

to calculate the half-life of a first-order reaction if we know the

rate constant.

Step 1:

Draw a graph of concentration (of hydrochloric acid) against time (Figure 22.7).

Step 2:

Draw tangents to the curve at various places corresponding to a range of concentrations.
In Figure 22.7 the tangent drawn corresponds to [HCl] = 1.04 mol dm−3.

Step 3:

For each tangent drawn, calculate the gradient and then the rate of reaction. In Figure

Figure 22.8: A graph showing how changes of concentration in hydrochloric acid or methanol affect the rate of
reaction. The curve shows that the reaction is likely to be second order.

Step 4:

Plot a graph of rate of reaction against concentration.
Figure 22.8 shows a plot of rate against the concentration of [HCl] or [CH3OH]. We have
included the [CH3OH] because if you look at the data in Table 22.5, you will see that the
concentration of CH3OH is decreasing at the same rate as the decrease in concentration
of HCl.

Figure 22.8 shows an upward curve. This indicates that the reaction is second order. But second order
with respect to what? As the concentrations of both HCl and CH3OH are decreasing at the same rate,
either of these may be second order. The possibilities are:

• rate = k[CH3OH] [HCl]
• rate = k[CH3OH]2
• rate = k[HCl]2
Further experiments would have to be carried out to confirm one or other of these possibilities. The
only thing we can be sure of is that the reaction is second order overall.

Question

a

Use the data from experiments 2 and 3 in Table 22.4 to calculate the rate constant for the
following reaction.
H2O2(aq) + 2I−(aq) + 2H+(aq) →
2H2O(l) + I2(aq)
The rate equation for this reaction is:
rate of reaction = k[H2O2] [I−]

b

Use the formula

to calculate a value for the rate constant of a reaction which is first

order and has a half-life of 480 s.
c

A first-order reaction has a rate constant of 9.63 × 10–5 s–1. Calculate a value for the half-life of
this reaction.

The effect of temperature on the rate constant
In Chapter 9, when studying the Boltzmann distribution curve, we learned that at higher temperatures a
greater proportion of the molecules have energy greater than the activation energy. So the rate of reaction
increases at higher temperatures. The rate constant, k, and therefore the rate of reaction, is proportional to
the fraction of molecules with energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. So the rate constant
increases as the temperature increases.
Figure 22.9a shows the effect of increasing temperature on rate of reaction. For every 10 °C rise in
temperature, the rate of reaction approximately doubles. The exact relationship between temperature and
the rate constant is given by the equation:
ln k = ln A −
where:
ln k is the natural logarithm of the rate constant
A is a constant related to the frequency of collisions and the orientation in which the molecules collide
EA is the activation energy
R is the gas constant
T is the temperature in kelvin
You do not have to learn this equation but it is useful for an understanding of how temperature affects the
rate constant.
A varies very little with temperature so can be thought of as being constant. EA and R are also constants.
So a graph of ln k against

should give a straight line of gradient

(Figure 22.9b).

Figure 22.9: The effect of increasing temperature on a rate of reaction b rate constant.

22.6 Deducing order of reaction from raw data
We can use any of the methods mentioned in Section 22.3 to determine the order of a reaction. In this
section we shall look in detail at some more complex examples.

Using data from the course of a reaction
For this method, we carry out one or more experiments with known initial concentrations of reactants and
follow the course of the reaction until it is complete (or nearly complete).
The steps in analysing the data are as follows.
Step 1: Plot a graph to show how the concentration of a particular reactant (or product) changes with time.
Step 2: Take tangents at various points along the curve which correspond to particular concentrations of
the reactant.
Step 3: Calculate the slope (gradient) at each concentration selected. The rate of reaction is calculated
from the slope of the graph.
Step 4: Plot a graph of rate of reaction against concentration.

Using initial rates
The initial rates method is often used when the rate of reaction is slow.
Carry out several experiments with different known initial concentrations of each reactant.
Measure the initial rates of reaction by either:
taking the tangent of the curve at the start of each experiment, or
measuring the concentration of a reactant or product soon after the experiment has started.
For each reactant, plot a graph of initial rate against concentration of that particular reactant.

Note that:

• the hydrogen ions have been provided by the hydrochloric acid.
In this method, we see how changing the concentration of each reactant in turn affects the rate of
reaction. In order to make a fair comparison, we must make sure that the concentrations of the other
reactants are kept constant.
Compare experiments 1 and 2 (propanone and iodine concentrations are constant):

• doubling the concentration of H+ ions from 0.625 to 1.25 mol dm−3 doubles the rate of reaction
• the reaction is first order with respect to H+ ions.
Compare experiments 1 and 3 (hydrochloric acid and iodine concentrations are constant):

• doubling the concentration of propanone from 0.25 × 10−3 to 0.50 × 10−3 mol dm−3 doubles the
rate of reaction

• the reaction is first order with respect to propanone.
Compare experiments 1 and 4 (hydrochloric acid and propanone concentrations are constant):

• doubling the concentration of iodine from 0.625 × 10−3 to 1.25 × 10−3 mol dm−3 has no effect on
the rate of reaction.

• the reaction is zero order with respect to iodine.

22.7 Kinetics and reaction mechanisms
The rate-determining step
In Worked example 5 you saw that for the reaction:
CH3COCH3 + I2

CH3COCH2I + HI

the iodine did not appear in the rate equation but the H+ ions did.
A reactant that appears in the chemical equation may have no effect on reaction rate.
A substance that is not a reactant in the chemical equation can affect reaction rate.
In organic chemistry, you have met the idea that reactions occur in a number of steps. We call this the
reaction mechanism. These steps do not take place at the same rate. The overall rate of reaction depends
on the slowest step. We call this the rate-determining step. If the concentration of a reactant appears in
the rate equation, then that reactant (or substances that react together to form it) appears in the ratedetermining step. If a substance does not appear in the overall rate equation it does not take part in the
rate-determining step. So, for the reaction between propanone and iodine, H+ ions are involved in the ratedetermining step but iodine is not.

Verifying possible reaction mechanisms
We can use kinetic data to confirm proposed reaction mechanisms. It is important to realise that the
mechanism is not deduced from the kinetic data. The kinetic data simply show us that a proposed reaction
mechanism is possible.
Various mechanisms have been proposed for the reaction
CH3COCH3 + I2

CH3COCH2I + HI

Figure 22.12 shows one proposed mechanism.

Figure 22.12: Propanone molecules rapidly accept hydrogen ions to form an intermediate that slowly forms propen-2-ol.
This reacts rapidly with iodine to give the products.

The rate equation for this reaction is
rate = k[CH3COCH3] [H+]
We could not have deduced this reaction mechanism from the rate equation. But the mechanism is
consistent with the rate equation.
The slow step (the rate-determining step) does not involve either propanone or hydrogen ions directly.
However, the intermediate with the formula

is derived from substances that react together to form it (propanone and hydrogen ions). So both
[CH3COCH3] and [H+] appear in the rate equation.
The reaction between iodine and the intermediate CH3C(OH)═CH2 is fast and iodine molecules are not
involved in the mechanism until after the rate-determining step. So the rate of reaction does not depend
on the concentration of iodine.
In Section 22.6 we saw that the rate equation for the reaction
2N2O5(g) → 4NO2(g) + O2
is rate = k[N2O5]. Figure 22.13 shows a suggested mechanism for this reaction. The rate equation suggests
that a single N2O5 molecule is involved in the rate-determining step. This fits in with the proposed
mechanism that suggests that the decomposition of N2O5 to form NO2 and NO3 is the slow step. The steps
that follow the slow step are relatively fast and so have no effect on reaction rate.

Figure 22.13: The rate equation tells us that the decomposition of individual molecules of nitrogen(V) oxide is the ratedetermining step. The subsequent reactions are very much faster by comparison, and do not influence the overall rate. Try
to match the reaction steps with the illustrations to get a picture of what is happening.

If there is only a single species (atom, ion or molecule) in the rate-determining step we call the reaction
unimolecular. If two species (which can be the same or different) are involved in the rate-determining step,
we say that the reaction is bimolecular. Mechanisms that involve a trimolecular step are rare. This is
because it is unlikely that three species will collide at the same time.

Question
11 An acidified solution of hydrogen peroxide reacts with iodide ions.
H2O2(aq) + 2H+(aq) + 2I−(aq) → 2H2O(l) + I2(aq)
The rate equation for this reaction is
rate = [H2O2] [I−]
The mechanism that follows has been proposed for this reaction.
H 2 O 2 + I−

H2O + IO−

H+ + IO−

HIO

HIO + H+ + I−

I2 + H 2 O

Explain why this mechanism is consistent with the rate equation.

IMPORTANT
Remember that the overall stoichiometry of a chemical equation does not tell us anything about the
reaction mechanism. A suggested mechanism should be consistent with the rate equation not the
stoichiometric equation.

Predicting the order of a reaction from reaction mechanisms
We can predict the order of reaction from a given reaction mechanism if we know the intermediates
present in the rate-determining step (or substances that react together to form the intermediate). Take, for
example, the reaction of propanone with bromine in alkaline solution.
CH3COCH3 + Br2 + OH− →
CH3COCH2Br + H2O + Br−
The reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 22.14.

Figure 22.14: The reaction mechanism for the bromination of propanone in alkaline conditions.

The rate-determining step in this reaction is the slow step. The slow step involves one molecule of
propanone and one hydroxide ion, so only these two species appear in the rate equation. The reaction is
second order overall, first order with respect to propanone and first order with respect to hydroxide ions.
rate = k[CH3COCH3] [OH−]
Bromine does not appear in the rate equation, as it takes part in a fast step after the rate-determining step.

Question

22.8 Catalysis
In Chapter 9 you saw that catalysts increase the rate of a chemical reaction. They do this by providing an
alternative pathway for the reaction with lower activation energy. Many transition element compounds are
catalysts (Figure 22.15).
We can divide catalysts into two main classes.
Homogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in the same phase as the reaction mixture. For
example: hydrogen ions catalyse the hydrolysis of esters.
CH3COOC2H5(aq) + H2O(l)
CH3COOH(aq) + C2H5OH(aq)
In this reaction the reactants, products and catalyst are all in the aqueous phase.

Figure 22.15: Addition polymers are produced using metallocene catalysts such as [(C5H5)2 ZrCH3]+. The strength and
puncture resistance of this polymer film have made it popular for food packaging.

Heterogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in a different phase to the reaction mixture.
For example, the decomposition of aqueous hydrogen peroxide is catalysed by manganese(IV) oxide.
2H2O2(aq)

2H2O(l) + O2(g)

The manganese(IV) oxide is in the solid phase, whereas the hydrogen peroxide is in aqueous solution.

Homogeneous catalysis
Homogeneous catalysis often involves changes in oxidation number of the ions involved in catalysis. For
example, small amounts of iodide ions catalyse the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. In the catalysed
reaction, iodide ions, I−, are first oxidised to iodate(I) ions, IO−. The IO− ions then react with further
molecules of hydrogen peroxide and are reduced back to iodide ions.
H2O2(aq) + I−(aq) → H2O(l) + IO−(aq)
H2O2(aq) + IO−(aq) → H2O(l) + I−(aq) + O2(g)
The overall equation is:
2H2O2(aq)

2H2O(l) + O2(g)

Ions of transition elements are often good catalysts because of their ability to change oxidation number.

Examples of homogeneous catalysis

IMPORTANT
Most examples of homogeneous catalysis involve redox reactions.

The iodine–peroxodisulfate reaction
Peroxodisulfate (persulfate) ions, S2O82−, oxidise iodide ions to iodine. This reaction is very slow.
S2O82−(aq) + 2I−(aq) → 2SO42−(aq) + I2(aq)
The peroxodisulfate and iodide ions both have a negative charge. In order to collide and react, these ions
need considerable energy to overcome the repulsive forces when like charges approach each other. Fe3+
(aq) ions catalyse this reaction. The catalysis involves two redox reactions.

Describe the results and suggest the common features of the oxides with catalytic power.

Reaction 1: reduction of Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions by I− ions:
2Fe3+(aq) + 2I−(aq) → 2Fe2+(aq) + I2(aq)
Reaction 2: oxidation of Fe2+ ions back to Fe3+ by S2O82− ions:
2Fe2+(aq) + S2O82−(aq) → 2Fe3+(aq) + 2SO42−(aq)
In both reactions 1 and 2, positively charged iron ions react with negatively charged ions. As ions with
unlike charges are attracted to each other, these reactions are more likely to occur than direct reaction
between S2O82− and I− ions.
You should notice that it doesn’t matter what the order is of the two reactions. The oxidation of Fe2+ ions to
Fe3+ by S2O82− ions could happen first:

2Fe2+(aq) + S2O82−(aq) → 2Fe3+(aq) + 2SO42−(aq)
followed by
2Fe3+(aq) + 2I−(aq) → 2Fe2+(aq) + I2(aq)
This reaction is catalysed by Fe3+(aq) and it is also catalysed by Fe2+(aq).
Figure 22.16 shows an energy level profile for the catalysed and the uncatalysed reactions. Note that the
catalysed reaction has two energy ‘humps’ because it is
a two-stage reaction.

Figure 22.16: Energy level profiles for the catalysed and uncatalysed reactions of peroxodisulfate ions with iodide ions.

In order for this catalysis to work, the standard electrode potentials for the reactions involving the catalyst
must lie between the electrode potentials involving the two reactants (Figure 22.17).

Figure 22.17: The electrode potential diagram for the catalysis of the reaction S2O82− + 2I− → 2SO42− + I2.

The use of electrode potentials in this way only predicts that the catalysis is possible. It does not give any
information about the rate of reaction.

Oxides of nitrogen and acid rain
Sulfur dioxide is produced when we burn fossil fuels containing sulfur. When sulfur dioxide escapes into the
atmosphere, it contributes to acid rain. One of the steps in the formation of acid rain is the oxidation of
sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide.
SO2(g) +

O2(g) → SO3(g)

This oxidation is catalysed by a wide variety of mechanisms. Nitrogen(IV) oxide present in the atmosphere
from a variety of sources (see Section 13.3) can catalyse the oxidation of sulfur dioxide. The nitrogen(IV)
oxide is re-formed by reaction with atmospheric oxygen.
SO2(g) + NO2(g) → SO3(g) + NO(g)

NO +

O2 → NO2(g)

Heterogeneous catalysis
Heterogeneous catalysis often involves gaseous molecules reacting at the surface of a solid catalyst. The
mechanism of this catalysis can be explained using the theory of adsorption. Chemical adsorption (also
called chemisorption) occurs when molecules become bonded to atoms on the surface of a solid. Transition
elements such as nickel are particularly good at chemisorbing hydrogen gas. Figure 22.18 shows the
process of adsorption of hydrogen onto a nickel surface.

Figure 22.18: The adsorption of hydrogen onto a nickel surface.

You must be careful to distinguish between the words adsorb and absorb. Adsorb means to bond to the
surface of a substance. Absorb means to move right into the substance: rather like a sponge absorbs
water.
The stages in adsorption of hydrogen onto nickel are:
hydrogen gas diffuses to the surface of the nickel
the hydrogen is physically adsorbed onto the surface: weak forces link the hydrogen molecules to the
nickel
the hydrogen becomes chemically adsorbed onto the surface: this causes stronger bonds to form
between the hydrogen and the nickel
this causes weakening of the hydrogen–hydrogen covalent bond.
When a reaction on the catalyst surface is complete, the bonds between the products and the catalyst
weaken so much that the products break away from the surface. This is called desorption.

Examples of heterogeneous catalysis
Iron in the Haber process
Particular conditions of temperature and pressure are required to form ammonia from nitrogen and
hydrogen (see Section 13.2). The reaction is catalysed by iron. The catalyst works by allowing hydrogen
and nitrogen molecules to come close together on the surface of the iron. They are then more likely to
react. Figure 22.19 shows the five steps in this heterogeneous catalysis.

Figure 22.19: A possible mechanism for catalysis in the Haber process.

1 Diffusion: nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas diffuse to the surface of the iron.
2 Adsorption: the reactant molecules are chemically adsorbed onto the surface of the iron. The bonds
formed between the reactant molecules and the iron are:

• strong enough to weaken the covalent bonds within the nitrogen and hydrogen molecules so the
atoms can react with each other

• weak enough to break and allow the products to leave the surface.
3 Reaction: the adsorbed nitrogen and hydrogen atoms react on the surface of the iron to form
ammonia.
4 Desorption: the bonds between the ammonia and the surface of the iron weaken and are eventually
broken.
5 Diffusion: ammonia diffuses away from the surface of the iron.

IMPORTANT
For the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis remember the order:
adsorption → old bonds breaking and
new bonds forming → desorption

Transition elements in catalytic converters
Catalytic converters are fitted to car exhausts to reduce the amount of harmful nitrogen oxides escaping
into the atmosphere. Once warmed up, the catalyst speeds up the conversion of nitrogen oxides to
harmless nitrogen gas and the conversion of poisonous carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. Unburned
hydrocarbons from car engines may also reduce the nitrogen oxides in a catalytic reaction. Simplified
equations for the overall reaction are:
2NO(g) + CO(g) → N2(g) + CO2(g)
and
2NO2(g) + 4CO(g) → N2(g) + 4CO2(g)
The ‘honeycomb’ structure inside the catalytic converter contains small beads coated with platinum,
palladium or rhodium. These act as heterogeneous catalysts. Possible steps in the catalytic process
include:
adsorption of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide onto the catalyst surface
weakening of the covalent bonds within the nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide
formation of new bonds between
adjacent nitrogen atoms (to form nitrogen molecules)
carbon monoxide and oxygen atoms to form carbon dioxide
desorption of nitrogen molecules and carbon dioxide molecules from the surface of the catalyst.

SUMMARY
The general form of the rate equation is: rate = k[A]m[B]n, where:
• k is the rate constant
• [A] and [B] are the concentrations of those reactants that affect the rate of reaction
• m is the order of the reaction with respect to A and n is the order of reaction with respect to B.
The order of reaction can be determined from graphs of reaction rate against concentration.
The half-life of a first-order reaction may be used in calculations to find the first-order rate constant using the
relationship:

The rate-determining step is the slowest step in a reaction mechanism. The rate-determining step determines the
overall rate of reaction.
The order of reaction with respect to a particular reactant shows how many molecules of that reactant are involved
in the rate-determining step of a reaction.
The order of a reaction can be predicted from a given reaction mechanism knowing the rate-limiting step.
Homogeneous catalysis occurs when a catalyst and the reactants are in the same phase.
Heterogeneous catalysis occurs when a catalyst is in a different phase from the reactants.
The mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis involves the processes of adsorption, reaction and desorption.

Entropy and Gibbs free

LEARNING INTENTIONS
In this chapter you will learn how to:
define the term entropy as being the number of possible arrangements of the particles and their energy in a given
system
predict and explain the sign of the entropy changes that occur during a change in state, during a temperature
change and during a reaction in which there is a change in the number of gaseous molecules
calculate the entropy change for a reaction using standard entropy values of the reactants and products
perform calculations using the Gibbs equation ΔG⦵ = ΔH⦵ − TΔS⦵
determine if a reaction is feasible by referring to the sign of ΔG⦵

predict the effect of temperature change on the feasibility of a reaction when given standard enthalpy and entropy
changes
⦵ .
predict the feasibility of a reaction using the equation ΔG⦵ = −nFEcell

BEFORE YOU START

1

Work with another learner. Take it in turns to explain to each other the meaning of the chemical
terms: surroundings, system, feasible, bond rotation, bond stretching.

2

Explain Hess’s law to another learner.

3

Write a paragraph explaining why it is important to take the state (solid, liquid or gas) into account
when you are carrying out calculations involving enthalpy changes. Share your ideas with the rest
of the class.

4

Ask another learner to select an example of a chemical reaction involving at least one compound
as a reactant. Explain to the other learner exactly how to calculate the enthalpy change of this
reaction (remember to take note of the stoichiometry of the reaction). Then reverse the process:
you choose the reaction and the other learner explains.

WHY DO RUBBER BANDS HAVE ELASTIC PROPERTIES?
Entropy can be thought of as a measure of randomness or disorder. The second law of
thermodynamics states that the total entropy increases in all processes that take place by themselves
(spontaneous changes). In other words, reactions go in the direction of more disorder.
Some rubbery polymers show an amazing elastic behaviour. Natural rubber is a polymer that can be
stretched up to six times its original length. But it still returns to its original length when the pulling
force is removed.
A polymer chain with freely rotating bonds, i.e. single bonds, can be coiled into thousands of different
shapes all having similar energy. The natural shape of the chain (random unstretched coils) has the
highest entropy. The most unlikely shape is a perfectly ordered straight chain.
For stretching to take place, the molecules must have some freedom to move and the polymer must
have weak intermolecular forces between the chains. When we stretch an elastic band, we straighten
out the chain by applying a force. This can be easily done with a very small force since it only involves
rotation of the bonds rather than stretching the bonds (Figure 23.1).
So why does the elastic go back to a random coil when the stretching force is removed? It is because
entropy rather than energy is the important factor in a spontaneous change. The stretched form has
lower entropy because the polymer chains are more ordered (less random). So when the stretching
force is removed, the rubber goes back to the form with greater entropy (more randomness).
Remember from the second law of thermodynamics that processes go in the direction of more
disorder!

Figure 23.1: In diagram a the polymer chains are stretched and have low entropy. In diagram b the polymer chains
are unstretched and have high entropy.

Qestion for discussion
Read the following paragraph about rubber production.
Natural rubber is produced from the latex (white sap) of various types of tree. The latex is removed by
making a slit in the trunk and collecting the latex. The latex is then coagulated with the help of
methanoic acid and sodium metabisulfite. Ammonia and sodium sulfite are often added as
preservatives. Phosphates are sometimes added as well. Sulfuric acid used in the process of ‘curing’
the rubber can also be reduced to hydrogen sulfide gas. The rubber sheets are dried near where the
rubber is produced, either in the air or often using a ‘smokehouse’ where wood or another fuel is
burned to help dry the sheets. The rubber is then washed with plenty of water.
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
What environmental problems can arise during the production of rubber?

23.1 Introducing entropy
Entropy is a measure of the dispersal of energy at a specific temperature. Entropy can also be thought of
as a measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. The higher the randomness or disorder, the
greater the entropy of the system. A system is the part under investigation. In chemistry, this is the
chemical reaction itself, i.e. reactants being converted to products.
The system of magnesium reacting with sulfuric acid in a test-tube to form magnesium sulfate and
hydrogen releases energy to the surroundings.
The surroundings include:
the solvent (in this case water)
the air around the test-tube
the test-tube itself
anything dipping into the test-tube (e.g. a thermometer).
Changes that tend to continue to happen naturally are called spontaneous changes. Once started, a
spontaneous change will carry on. When a spark is applied, methane gas reacts with oxygen in a
spontaneous reaction to form carbon dioxide and water. The reaction is spontaneous because the methane
continues to burn in the oxygen until either the methane or oxygen is completely used up. For a reaction to
be spontaneous, it does not need to happen rapidly. Many spontaneous reactions are slow or need an input
of energy to start them.
Entropy can also be thought of as a dispersal of energy, either from the system to the surroundings or from
the surroundings to the system. The system becomes energetically more stable when it becomes more
disordered.

23.2 Chance and spontaneous change
Diffusion
If you spill a few drops of perfume in a closed room with no air draughts, the smell spreads gradually
throughout the room. The molecules in the perfume vapour, which are responsible for the smell, move
randomly in straight lines until they collide with air molecules, other perfume molecules or with the walls of
the room. After collision, the perfume molecules change direction. This process of random movement and
random collisions of molecules is called diffusion. The reason molecules in a vapour diffuse is because of
the laws of chance and probability.
We can make a model to show how, during a spontaneous process, the entropy of the system increases.
Figure 23.2 shows a system of two flasks connected by a stopcock. One flask contains helium and the other
contains argon. These gases do not react.

Figure 23.2: The spontaneous mixing of helium atoms (•) with argon atoms (•).

When the stopcock is opened, the gas atoms move spontaneously by diffusion. After mixing, the gases are
mixed up and there is more disorder than before mixing. The entropy has increased.

Diffusion and number of ways
We can show that the molecules in a vapour diffuse by chance. We do this by thinking about the probability
of finding them at one place at any one time. Consider the simplified model shown below.

The three molecules in gas jar A cannot move into gas jar B.
In this model we assume:
there are only a few molecules in gas jar A
there are no other particles present
the molecules move randomly and change directions when they collide.
After we remove the partition, the molecules can move randomly not only within gas jar A but also into gas
jar B. There are three molecules and two places in which they can be (gas jar A and gas jar B). The possible
ways of arranging the molecules after removing the partition are shown in Figure 23.3.

Figure 23.3: The eight possible arrangements of molecules after removing the partition between the gas jars.

There are eight different ways of arranging the three molecules between two gas jars. We can express this
as:

Each of these ways is equally likely (equally probable). So the chance that all the molecules will stay in gas
jar A is 1 in 8. Similarly, the chance that all three molecules will move over to gas jar B is 1 in 8. The
molecules diffuse because there are more ways of them being spread out than remaining in the same
place.
If we started with five molecules in gas jar A, the number of different ways of arranging the molecules is 25
= 32. If we scaled this up to the numbers of gas molecules that we might find in a container in the
laboratory, the number of ways of arranging the molecules is extremely large. For example, for a million
molecules between two gas jars, it would be 21 000 000, a number that is too large for your calculator to deal
with. Diffusion happens because there is an strong likelihood of it taking place as a result of the large
number of ways of arranging the molecules. The idea of the ‘number of ways’ of arranging either molecules
or the energy within molecules affects whether the changes that take place are the ones that are most
likely to happen. This applies to chemical reactions as well as to physical processes such as diffusion.

IMPORTANT
Entropy is greater if:
there are more ways of arranging the energy in a molecule or atom
there are more ways of arranging the molecules or atoms in a given volume.

Question

For this question, refer back to Figure 23.3. If there are four molecules in the gas jar on the left,
how many ways of arranging the molecules are there when the partition is removed?

v

vi

Comparing entropy values
To make any comparison of entropy values fair, we must use standard conditions. These standard
conditions are the same as those used for ΔH:
a pressure of 105 Pa
a temperature of 298 K (25 °C)
each substance involved in the reaction is in its normal physical state (solid, liquid or gas) at 105 Pa
and 298 K.

Under these conditions, and for a mole of substance, the unit of standard molar entropy, S⦵, is J K−1 mol−1.
Standard molar entropy is the entropy of one mole of substance in its standard state. The symbol ⦵
indicates that the entropy is at standard conditions.
Table 23.1 shows some values for some standard molar entropies.

Table 23.1: Standard molar entropy values of some solids, liquids and gases. The states are shown as state symbols after
each substance.

The values of all standard molar entropies are positive. Remember that elements have positive standard
molar entropy values. Do not mix entropies up with enthalpies: the elements in their standard states have
enthalpy values of zero.
The entropy values are compared to a theoretically perfect crystal. The third law of thermodynamics states
that ‘All perfect crystals have the same entropy at a temperature of absolute zero’. The nearest we can get
to this is a perfect diamond weighing 12 g cooled to as low a temperature as possible.
From the values in the table and other data we can make some generalisations:
Gases generally have much higher entropy values than liquids, and liquids have higher entropy values
than solids (see Figure 23.4). There are exceptions to this. For example, calcium carbonate (solid) has a
higher entropy value than mercury (liquid).

Simpler substances with fewer atoms have lower entropy values than more complex substances with a
greater number of atoms. For example, for calcium oxide, CaO, S⦵ = 39.7 J K−1 mol−1, but for calcium
carbonate, CaCO3, S⦵ = 92.9 J K−1 mol−1. Carbon monoxide, CO, has a lower entropy value than
carbon dioxide, CO2.
For similar types of substances, harder substances have a lower entropy value. For example, diamond
has a lower entropy value than graphite and calcium has a lower entropy value than lead.
For a given substance, the entropy increases as a solid melts and then changes to a vapour (see Figure
23.5). For example, the molar entropy of ice just below its melting point is 48.0 J K−1 mol−1. The molar
entropy for water is 69.9 J K−1 mol−1, but just above its boiling point, the value increases to 188.7 J K−1
mol−1. There is a gradual increase in entropy as the temperature of a substance is increased.
Increasing the temperature of a solid makes the molecules, atoms or ions vibrate more. Increasing the
temperature of a liquid or gas increases the entropy because it increases the disorder of the particles.
When a substance melts or vaporises, there is a large increase in entropy because there is a very large
increase in the disorder of the particles.

Figure 23.4: a A diamond has a very low entropy value because it is a solid element with atoms regularly arranged. b
Bromine has a high entropy value because it tends to spread out.

Figure 23.5: The change in entropy as a substance melts and then boils.

When a solid changes to a liquid
The regularly arranged lattice of particles close together in the solid changes to an irregular arrangement
of particles, which are close together but rotate and slide over each other in the liquid.

When a liquid changes to a vapour
The irregular arrangement of particles in the liquid which are close together and rotating changes to an
irregular arrangement of particles which are free to move around rapidly because they are far apart from
each other.

IMPORTANT
Note that when a gas condenses to a liquid or a liquid changes to a solid, the entropy decreases
because the particles are going from a more disordered state to a more ordered state. There are also
fewer ways of arranging the energy in a solid.
When a solid dissolves in a solvent, the entropy generally increases. In the solid, the particles are ordered
and can only vibrate. The entropy is low. When dissolved in a solvent to form a dilute solution, the particles
are spread out from each other and can move randomly from place to place. The entropy is high because
not only are the particles spread out more but also the number of ways of arranging the energy is greater.
So, there is generally an increase in entropy on dissolving. Conversely, when a salt crystallises from a
solution, the entropy decreases because some of the random mobile particles in the solution are becoming
ordered particles in the crystal.

IMPORTANT
Care must be taken when discussing the entropy change of solution. For concentrated aqueous
solutions of salts which have highly charged ions, there may be a considerable order in the solvent due
to several hydration layers around these ions.

SO2(g) (S⦵ = 248.1 J K−1 mol−1) and SO3(l) (S⦵ = 95.60 J K−1 mol−1)

Entropy changes in reactions
In a chemical reaction, if we compare the entropies of the reactants and products, we can try to explain the
magnitude of the entropy change and whether or not it increases or decreases. We will assume that gases
have high entropy and solids have low entropy. If there is a change in the number of gaseous molecules in
a reaction, there is likely to be a significant entropy change. This is because high values of entropy are
associated with gases. The more gas molecules, there are, the greater the number of ways of arranging
them and the higher the entropy. For example, in the reaction:
CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)
there is an increase in entropy of the system because a gas is being produced (high entropy) but the
reactant, calcium carbonate, is a solid (low entropy).
In the reaction 2N2O5(g) → 4NO2(g) + O2(g)
we should expect an increase of entropy of the system because there is a greater number of moles of gas
molecules in the products (5 molecules) than in the reactants (2 molecules). In addition, there are two
different product molecules but only one type of reactant molecule. This also contributes to a greater
disorder in the products compared with the reactants. The system becomes energetically more stable when
it becomes more disordered.
In the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)
we should expect a decrease in the entropy of the system because there is a reduction in the number of
gas molecules as the reaction proceeds. So the entropy change of the system is negative. The reactants,
hydrogen and nitrogen, are more stable than the product, ammonia.

23.3 Calculating entropy changes
Entropy changes in exothermic and endothermic reactions
Energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings (exothermic change) or from the
surroundings to the system (endothermic change). The surroundings are so large that when energy
exchange takes place there is such a small change in temperature or pressure that we can ignore this.
For an exothermic reaction, the energy released to the surroundings increases the number of ways of
arranging the energy. This is because the energy goes into rotation and translation (movement from
place to place) of molecules in the surroundings. So there is likely to be an increase in entropy and an
increased probability of the chemical change occurring spontaneously. In other words, the reaction
becomes more feasible.
For an endothermic reaction, the energy absorbed from the surroundings decreases the number of
ways of arranging the energy. So there is likely to be a decrease in entropy and a decreased probability
of the chemical change occurring spontaneously.

Total entropy change
IMPORTANT
You do not have to know the equation
⦵
⦵
⦵
ΔStotal
= ΔSsystem
+ ΔSsurroundings

for your examination, but this section is useful for a general understanding of entropy.
We can use entropy values to predict whether a chemical reaction will occur spontaneously or not. When a
chemical reaction takes place there is a change in entropy because the reactants and products have
different entropy values. The symbol for standard entropy change is ΔS⦵. The total entropy change
involves both the system and the surroundings. For the system (reactants and products), we write the
⦵
⦵
entropy change as ΔSsystem
. For the surroundings we write the entropy change as ΔSsurroundings
.
The total entropy change is given by:
⦵
⦵
⦵
ΔStotal
= ΔSsystem
+ ΔSsurroundings

⦵
If the total entropy change increases, the entropy change is positive, e.g. ΔStotal
is +40 J K−1 mol−1. The
reaction will then occur spontaneously. We say that the reaction is feasible.

⦵
If the total entropy change decreases, the entropy change is negative, e.g. ΔStotal
is −40 J K−1 mol−1. The
reaction is then not likely to occur.

Calculating the entropy change of the system
In order to calculate the entropy change of a system, we use the relationship:
⦵
⦵
⦵
ΔSsystem
= ΣSproducts
− ΣSreactants

⦵
The symbol ‘Σ’ means ‘the sum of’. So, to calculate ΔSsystem
we add the entropy values of the products and
the entropy values of the reactants separately, then take away the sum of the reactants from the sum of
the products.

Note:

1 We need to take account of the stoichiometry of the equation (as we did in calculations involving ΔH⦵).
2 When looking up entropy values in tables of data, we need to choose the data for the correct state,
solid, liquid or gas.

WORKED EXAMPLES

1

Calculate the entropy change of the system for the reaction:
2Ca(s) + O2(g) → 2CaO(s)

Solution
The standard entropy values are:
S⦵ [Ca(s)] = 41.40 J K−1 mol−1

S⦵ [O2(g)] = 205.0 J K−1 mol−1

S⦵ [CaO(s)] = 39.70 J K−1 mol−1
⦵
⦵
⦵
ΔSsystem
= ΣSproducts
− ΣSreactants

= 2 × S⦵ [CaO(s)] − {2 × S⦵ [Ca(s)] + S⦵ [O2(g)]}
= 2 × 39.70 − {(2 × 41.40) + 205.0}
= 79.40 − 287.8

⦵
ΔSsystem
= −208.4 J K−1 mol−1

The negative value for the entropy change shows that the entropy of the system has decreased. We
know, however, that calcium reacts spontaneously with oxygen. So the entropy of the surroundings
must also play a part because the total entropy change must be positive for the reaction to be
feasible.
2

Calculate the entropy change of the system for the reaction:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)

Solution
The standard entropy values are:
S⦵ [CH4(g)] = 186.2 J K−1 mol −1
S⦵ [O2(g)] = 205.0 J K−1 mol−1

S⦵ [CO2(g)] = 213.6 J K−1 mol−1

S⦵ [H2O(g)] = 188.7 J K−1 mol−1
⦵
⦵
⦵
ΔSsystem
= ΣSproducts
− ΣSreactants

= {S⦵ [CO2(g)] + 2 × S⦵ [H2O(g)]} − {S⦵ [CH4(g)] + 2 × S⦵ [O2(g)]}
= {213.6 + (2 × 188.7)} − {186.2 + (2 × 205.0)}
= 591.0 − 596.2

⦵
ΔSsystem
= −5.2 J K−1 mol−1

The negative value for the entropy change shows that the entropy of the system has decreased
slightly. We know, however, that methane burns in oxygen once it is ignited. So the entropy of the
surroundings must also play a part in the overall entropy change.

⦵

⦵
You do not have to know the equation
useful for a general understanding of entropy.

for your examination but the equation is

Many chemical reactions are accompanied by large enthalpy changes. These enthalpy changes change the
number of ways of arranging the energy in the surroundings. So, in many chemical reactions, the value of
the entropy changes in the surroundings cannot be ignored.
The entropy change of the surroundings is calculated using the relationship:
⦵

⦵

where

⦵
ΔHreaction

T is the temperature in kelvin. At standard temperature, this value is 298 K.
Note:
⦵
⦵
1 When performing calculations to find ΔSsurroundings
the value of ΔHreaction
in kJ mol−1 should be multiplied by
1000. This is because entropy changes are measured in units of joules per kelvin per mole.
⦵
2 The negative sign in front of ΔHreaction
is part of the equation and not the sign of the enthalpy change. If

the enthalpy change is negative, the whole

Calculating total entropy change
Note: This section about total entropy change is extension material. You will not be examined on it but it
does give you a useful insight into how the surroundings are important in driving the direction of a
reaction.
The total entropy change is given by:

⦵

⦵

The total entropy changes for the examples given above for the reactions of calcium with oxygen and the
combustion of methane are calculated by simply adding the entropy change of the system to the entropy
change of the surroundings.
You can see that in both Worked examples 5 and 6, the large positive entropy change of the surroundings
more than compensates for the negative entropy change of the system. The total entropy change is
positive and the reactions are feasible.

Entropy in equilibrium reactions
In equilibrium reactions, both products and reactants are present. How can the total entropy change be
positive in both directions? There is an additional increase in disorder and so an increase in entropy
associated with this mixing.
Figure 23.6 shows how the increase in entropy changes as a reaction progresses, starting either from pure
reactants or pure products to reach equilibrium. As mixing proceeds, the rate of increasing disorder
decreases as more and more NO2 molecules are formed from N2O4. At some stage in the reaction, the rate
of the forward reaction equals the rate of the backward reaction. Equilibrium has been reached. The same
argument applies to the reverse reaction.

NO2 is converted to the same equilibrium mixture.

At the position of equilibrium, the total entropy change of the forward reaction equals the total entropy
change of the backward reaction, and under standard conditions the overall entropy change is zero.

Entropy and temperature
IMPORTANT
You do not have to know the equation
⦵

⦵

for your examination but this section has relevance for work later on in the chapter.
The entropy change of the surroundings is given by
⦵

⦵

If we carry out reactions at temperatures above standard temperature, an increase in temperature makes
the entropy change of the surroundings less negative or more positive. If we carry out reactions at
temperatures below standard temperature, a decrease in temperature makes the entropy change of the
⦵
surroundings more negative or less positive. In both these cases we make the assumption that ΔHreaction
⦵
does not change significantly with temperature. In reality, ΔHreaction
does change slightly with temperature,
but we can often disregard this change.
We can see how increasing the temperature affects the ability of zinc carbonate to undergo thermal
decomposition by comparing the entropy changes at 298 K and 550 K. However, we have to take into
account both the surroundings and the system. We assume that neither the standard molar entropies nor
the enthalpy change of formation changes with temperature.
ZnCO3(s) → ZnO(s) + CO2(g)

⦵
ΔHreaction
= +72.3 kJ mol−1

⦵
For this reaction ΔSsystem
= +174.8 J K−1 mol−1 (the same for both temperatures).

Reaction at 298 K
⦵

= −242.6 J K−1 mol−1

⦵
Stotal
= +174.8 − 242.6 J K−1 mol−1
⦵
Stotal
= −67.8 J K−1 mol−1

Reaction at 550 K
⦵

= −131.5 J K−1 mol−1

⦵
Stotal
= +174.8 − 131.5 J K−1 mol−1
⦵
Stotal
= +43.3 J K−1 mol−1

You can see that at 298 K the total entropy change is negative, so the reaction does not occur at this
temperature. At 550 K the total entropy change is positive, so the reaction is spontaneous at this
temperature.
When the total entropy change in a reaction shows a large increase, e.g. +200 J K−1 mol−1, the
reaction can be regarded as going to completion. It is definitely spontaneous.
When the total entropy change shows a large decrease, e.g. −600 J K−1 mol−1, we can deduce that
there is very little likelihood of a reaction occurring.

= −890.3 kJ mol−1
the entropy change of the system is negative. But the large negative value of the enthalpy change more
than compensates for the negative entropy change of the system. This is because it causes the term
⦵

to have a high positive value. So the total energy change is positive and the reaction, once
⦵
started, is spontaneous. In highly exothermic reactions, where the value of ΔHreaction
is large and negative,
the enthalpy change is the driving force of the reaction.
⦵

In endothermic reactions, the entropy term tends to be more important. The term
has a negative
⦵
⦵
value. If the value of ΔSsystem and ΔSsurroundings are both negative, then the reaction will not be spontaneous.
⦵
However, if the value of ΔSsystem
is positive and large enough, it can compensate for the negative value of
⦵
⦵
the ΔSsurroundings
so that ΔStotal
becomes positive. The reaction is spontaneous.
Chemists are usually interested in the system of reactants and products rather than having to consider the
energy changes with the surroundings. Fortunately for us, there is a way in which we can take account of
both system and surroundings in a more straightforward way. This involves a quantity called Gibbs free
energy or, more simply, free energy. It can also be called Gibbs energy or Gibbs function, G (Figure 23.7).

Figure 23.7: Gibbs free energy is named after American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs, who applied the concept of entropy
and ‘applied energy’ changes to chemical reactions and physical processes.

IMPORTANT
When selecting entropy and free energy values from tables of data, make sure that you look carefully
at the state symbols.

23.5 Gibbs free energy
What is Gibbs free energy?
In determining whether a chemical reaction is likely to be spontaneous, we use the quantity Gibbs free
energy change, ΔG. The Gibbs free energy change is given by the relationship:
ΔG = −TΔStotal
We can also write the expression without having to consider the entropy changes of the surroundings. This
expression is called the Gibbs equation.
⦵
⦵
ΔG⦵ = ΔHreaction
− TΔSsystem

where T is the temperature in kelvin.
Gibbs free energy is a useful concept because it includes both enthalpy change and entropy change.
To make any comparison of Gibbs free energy values fair, we must use standard conditions. These standard
conditions are the same as those used for ΔH and ΔS:
pressure of 105 Pa
temperature of 298 K (25 °C)
each substance involved in the reaction is in its normal physical state (solid, liquid or gas) at 105 Pa
and 298 K.
The standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation is the free energy change that accompanies the
formation of one mole of a compound from its elements in their standard state.
The symbol for standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation is ΔGf⦵. The units are kJ mol−1.
For example:
Mg(s) +

O2(g) → MgO(s)

ΔGf⦵ = −569.4 kJ mol−1

Derivation
Gibbs free energy can easily be derived from the equation relating total entropy to the entropy changes of
system and surroundings.
As:
⦵
⦵
ΔStotal
= ΔSsystem
+

⦵

⦵
⦵
Multiplying by −T: − TΔStotal
= −TΔSsystem
+ ΔH⦵

⦵
The term − TΔSsystem
+ ΔH⦵ is equivalent to the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction system ΔG⦵.
⦵
⦵
So −TΔStotal
= ΔG⦵ and so ΔG⦵ = ΔH⦵ − TΔSsystem

Gibbs free energy and spontaneous reactions
IMPORTANT
The words spontaneous and feasible both have meanings of ‘likely to happen’. We use the word
feasible for chemical reactions. The word spontaneous is a more general term and applies to physical
processes such as diffusion and dissolving as well.
⦵
For a reaction to be feasible (spontaneous), ΔStotal
must be positive. The value of T is always positive on the
⦵
absolute (kelvin) temperature scale. So applying these signs to the relationship ΔG⦵ = − TStotal
, the value of
ΔG must be negative for a reaction to be spontaneous. So, when a feasible (spontaneous) reaction occurs
at constant temperature and pressure, the value of the Gibbs free energy is negative. If the value of ΔG is

positive, the reaction is not feasible.

⦵
Applying the equation ΔG⦵ = ΔH⦵ − TΔSsystem
IMPORTANT
In calculations involving the equation
⦵
ΔG⦵ = ΔH⦵ − TΔSsystem

don’t forget to multiply the value of ΔH⦵ by 1000 if ΔH⦵ is in kJ. This is because the units of ΔS⦵ are in
joules per kelvin per mole.
We can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for a reaction if we know:
the entropy change of the system in J K−1 mol−1
the enthalpy change of the system in J mol−1; we may have to multiply the value of the enthalpy
change by 1000 to convert from kJ mol−1
the temperature: under standard conditions, this is 298 K.

As the value of ΔG⦵ is positive, the reaction is not spontaneous at 298 K.

HBr(g) = 98.6,
H2O(l) = 69.9

Temperature change and reaction spontaneity
For a reaction to be spontaneous, ΔG must be negative. The temperature can influence the spontaneity of
a reaction. We can deduce this by considering the Gibbs free energy as a combination of two terms in the
relationship:

Assuming that the value of ΔHreaction does not change much with temperature, we can see that the value of
TΔSsystem may influence the value of ΔG.
For an exothermic reaction, the first term (ΔHreaction) has a negative value.
If the value of ΔSsystem is positive, the second term (−TΔSsystem) is negative and the reaction will be
spontaneous because both ΔHreaction and −TΔSsystem are negative. So ΔG is negative.
If the value of ΔSsystem is negative, the second term is positive to overcome the negative value of
ΔHreaction and make ΔG positive. So the reaction is less likely to be spontaneous at a higher
temperature. This mirrors what we know about the effect of temperature on equilibrium: for an
exothermic reaction, a higher temperature shifts the position of the equilibrium in favour of the
reactants. The reaction is likely to be spontaneous if the temperature is low because ΔHreaction is more
likely to have a greater negative value than the positive value of the second term. So ΔG is negative. If
the temperature is very high, the second term may be positive enough to shift the position of

equilibrium in favour of the reactants.
For an endothermic reaction, the first term (ΔHreaction) has a positive value.
If the value of ΔSsystem is negative, the second term is positive. The reaction will not occur because
both terms are positive, making the value of ΔG positive.
If the value of ΔSsystem is positive, the second term is negative. The reaction is unlikely to be
spontaneous if the temperature is low because ΔHreaction is more likely to have a greater positive value
than the negative value of the second term. So ΔG is positive. If the temperature is very high, the
second term may be negative enough to overcome the positive value of ΔHreaction and make ΔG
negative. So the reaction is more likely to be spontaneous at a higher temperature. This mirrors what
we know about the effect of temperature on equilibrium: for an endothermic reaction, a higher
temperature shifts the position of equilibrium in favour of the products.
We can see the effect of temperature on the spontaneity of the reaction if we rework Worked example 7 at
a temperature of 1200 K.

Comparing Gibbs free energy values
Table 23.2 shows some values for some standard molar Gibbs free energy changes of formation.
You learned in Chapter 6 that the standard enthalpy change of an element is zero. Similarly, the standard
Gibbs free energy change of formation of an element is zero. Many compounds in the solid state have high
negative values of Gibbs free energy change of formation. Many gases and liquids have standard Gibbs
free energy change values that are negative but many others, such as ethene, have positive values. The
standard Gibbs free energy change of formation also depends on the state. For example, ΔGf⦵ [H2O(l)] is
−237.2 kJ mol−1 but ΔGf⦵ [H2O(g)] is −228.6 kJ mol−1.

23.6 Gibbs free energy calculations
Gibbs free energy change of reaction
IMPORTANT
Note that for any type of enthalpy change, e.g. enthalpy change of formation, or enthalpy change of
⦵
reaction, you can get a corresponding Gibbs free energy change, e,g. ΔGf⦵ orΔGreaction
. The Gibbs free
energy change you will be using will usually be the Gibbs free energy change of formation.

Calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the decomposition of zinc carbonate at 1200 K.

ΔHr⦵ = +71.0 kJ mol−1

Values for S⦵ in J K−1 mol−1: CO2(g) = +213.6, ZnCO3(s) = +82.4, ZnO(s) = +43.6

Solution

ΔHr⦵ = +71.0 kJ mol−1

= 71 000 − 1200 × (+174.8)
ΔG

⦵

= 71 000 − 209 760
= −139 kJ mol−1

As the value of ΔG⦵ is negative, the reaction is spontaneous at 1200 K.

The standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction is the Gibbs free energy change when the amounts of
the reactants shown in the stoichiometric equation react under standard conditions to give products. The
reactants and products must be in their standard states.
The method of calculating Gibbs free energy change of reaction uses an energy cycle similar to the
enthalpy cycles you used to calculate the enthalpy change of reaction in Chapter 6 (see Figure 23.8).

Figure 23.8: A free energy cycle for calculating the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction. The dashed line shows the
indirect (two-step) route.

Using the same ideas as in Hess’s law, we see that:
⦵
ΔG2⦵ = ΔG1⦵ + ΔGreaction

⦵
So: ΔGreaction
= ΔG1⦵ − ΔG1⦵

Another way of writing this is:

⦵
⦵
⦵
ΔGreaction
= ΣΔGproducts
− ΣΔGreactants

IMPORTANT

⦵
If you are doing a calculation to find ΔGreaction
, you do not have to draw an energy cycle unless asked.
⦵
⦵
⦵
Just use ΣΔGreaction
= ΣΔGproducts
− ΣΔGreactants

To calculate the Gibbs free energy change of reaction from an energy cycle like this, we use the following
procedure:
write the balanced equation at the top
draw the cycle with the elements at the bottom
draw in all arrows making sure that they go in the correct directions

⦵
calculate ΔGreaction
= ΔG2⦵ − ΔG1⦵ taking into account the number of moles of reactants and products.

Draw a Gibbs free energy cycle to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change of decomposition
of sodium hydrogencarbonate.
2NaHCO3(s) → Na2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)
The relevant Gibbs free energy values are:
ΔGf⦵ [NaHCO3(s)] = −851.0 kJ mol−1

ΔGf⦵ [Na2CO3(s)] = −1044.5 kJ mol−1
ΔGf⦵ [CO2(g)] = −394.4 kJ mol−1

= −1676.1 − (−1702)

⦵
The value of ΔGreaction

However, ΔGreaction
does vary with temperature. At a higher temperature the reaction is spontaneous.

⦵
ΔGreaction

= −546.4 kJ

⦵
The value of ΔGreaction
is negative. So under standard conditions, the reaction is spontaneous.

Gibbs free energy and work
Gibbs free energy change can be thought of as part of the enthalpy change that is needed to do work. If we
rearrange the equation ΔG = ΔH − TΔS as ΔH = ΔG + TΔS, we can regard the +TΔS part as being the
energy unavailable to do work because it is involved with the disorder of the system (Figure 23.10). The ΔG
part is free energy that is available to do work, e.g. driving the charge in electrochemical cells.

Figure 23.10: The enthalpy change of a reaction at constant temperature can be split into two parts.

Gibbs free energy change and direction of chemical change
Gibbs free energy of formation is a measure of the stability of a compound. The more negative the value of
ΔGf⦵, the greater the stability of the compound. It is unlikely to decompose. If ΔGf⦵ is positive, the compound
is likely to be unstable with respect to its elements. For example:
H2(g) +

I2(s) → HI(g)

ΔGf⦵ [HI(g)] = +1.7 kJ mol−1

The Gibbs free energy change of reaction is also a measure of the feasibility of a reaction. Reactions with
⦵
negative values of ΔGreaction
are likely to be feasible (spontaneous), whereas those with positive values are
less likely to be spontaneous.
When a system is in chemical equilibrium and the amounts of products and reactants balance, the
⦵
⦵
value of ΔGreaction
is zero (ΔGreaction
= 0).

⦵
The products predominate if the value of ΔGreaction
has a fairly low negative value, e.g. −10 kJ mol−1.

⦵
The reactants predominate if the value of ΔGreaction
has a slightly positive value, e.g. +10 kJ mol−1.

⦵
The reaction can be regarded as complete if the value of ΔGreaction
is high and negative, e.g. −60 kJ mol
−1.
⦵
The reaction can be regarded as not being feasible (spontaneous) at all if the value of ΔGreaction
is high
−1
and positive, e.g. +60 kJ mol .

H2O2(l) = −120.4, MgO(s) = −569.4, NaCl(s) = −384.2,
NH4NO3(s) = −184.0, N2O(g) = +104.2
a

2H2O2(l) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g)

b

e

3Mg(s) + Fe2O3(s) → 3MgO(s) + 2Fe(s)

Gibbs free energy change and standard electrode potential

⦵
In Chapter 20 we learned that the standard electrode potential, Ecell
, can be used to determine whether a
reaction is feasible or not.
⦵
If the value of Ecell
is zero then the reaction is in an equilibrium where the products and reactants are
balanced. The position of equilibrium is neither to the right nor to the left.
⦵
If the value of Ecell
is about +0.1 V, there are more products than reactants.
⦵
If the value of Ecell
is about −0.1 V, there are more reactants than products.

⦵
If the value of Ecell
is more positive than about +0.6 V the reaction goes to completion.

⦵
If the value of Ecell
is more negative than about −0.6 V there is no reaction or minimal reaction.

⦵
Since the values of Ecell
and ΔG⦵ both tell us about whether a reaction is feasible or not, there must be a
relationship between them.

This relationship is:
⦵
ΔG⦵ = −nFEcell

where:

ΔG⦵ is the standard Gibbs free energy in J mol−1
n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the cell reaction
F is the charge on a mole of electrons in C mol−1 (this is the Faraday, 96 500 C mol−1)
⦵
Ecell
is the standard cell potential.

IMPORTANT

⦵
Note that when you apply the equation ΔG⦵ = −nFEcell
, the units of ΔG⦵ are in J mol−1 (not KJ mol−1).
This is because the equation is derived from a relationship between entropy, enthalpy change and
temperature and the units of entropy are J mol−1.

WORKED EXAMPLE
11 Calculate the standard free energy change for the reaction of magnesium with zinc ions and state
whether the reaction is feasible.

Mg2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Mg(s)
Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s)

Solution

⦵
Ecell
= −2.38 V
⦵
Ecell
= −0.76 V

Step 1:

⦵
Calculate the value of Ecell
.

Step 2:

Note the number of electrons transferred = 2

Step 3:

Substitute the values into the expression:

⦵
Ecell
= −0.76 + (+2.38) = +1.62 V

⦵
ΔG⦵ = −nFEcell

ΔG⦵ = −2 × 96 500 × +1.62 = −313 kJ mol−1

So the reaction is feasible. It will go to completion since the value of ΔG⦵ is large and
negative.

SUMMARY
Entropy, S, is the number of possible arrangements of the particles and their energy in a given system.
A spontaneous change or feasible reaction involves an increase in total entropy (ΔS is positive). If a reaction is not
feasible, there is a decrease in entropy (ΔS is negative).
The entropy increases as a substance changes state from solid to liquid to gas or dissolves to form a solution.
A knowledge of the structures and states of reactants and products helps us make generalisations about whether or
not the entropy of the reactants is greater than the entropy of the products.
The entropy change in the system is given by ΔSsystem = ΣΔSproducts − ΣΔSreactants

⦵
⦵
Gibbs free energy can be calculated using the Gibbs equation ΔG⦵ = ΔHreaction

The Gibbs free energy change of a reaction can be calculated from Gibbs free energy changes of formation using

FIGHTING CANCER
Most cancers are associated with abnormal DNA replication. During DNA replication, the double helix
‘unwinds’ to form the template for a new strand. When the process goes wrong, this can produce
mutations or can accelerate out of control. This results in cancerous tumours that can grow rapidly and
interfere with normal cells. Finding ways to fight cancers remains one of the main areas of medical
research today.
Cis-platin is an anti-cancer drug, first used in chemotherapy in the 1970s. The drug is a compound of
platinum, a transition element. Molecules of cis-platin are made up of platinum(II) ions, with dative
bonds to two chloride ions and two ammonia molecules. The bonds are arranged around the central
Pt2+ ion in a flat, square planar shape. Its structure is shown in Figure 24.1.

Figure 24.1: The square planar shape of cis-platin.

The cis-platin can be taken by patients in solution and can pass through cell membranes and into the
nucleus of the cell. There it can form a new platinum complex that can form a bridge within a DNA
strand. This ‘bridging’ can also take place to a lesser extent between the two strands in DNA.
With the platinum complex inserted into the strands, replication is disrupted, so the cell dies. If fast-

growing tumour cells are treated with cis-platin, the tumour shrinks and the cancer goes into
remission. This means that the signs and symptoms of the cancer disappear.
However, cis-platin can also interfere with DNA replication in normal healthy cells. Therefore, how
effective it is in fighting cancer depends on the balance between the death of healthy cells and the
death of cancerous cells. The cis-platin particularly affects fast-growing cells. So, the production of
white blood cells in bone marrow can be disrupted. This can leave patients open to infectious diseases
that would be no problem for a healthy person.
Cis-platin can also cause hair loss, kidney damage, and a range of other side-effects, such as hearing
loss. Yet, despite the discovery of many more complex, modern drugs, cis-platin is still used to treat a
variety of cancers. It is often used as part of a combined programme of drugs.

Questions for discussion
Carry out some research to find out more details of how cis-platin makes the ‘bridges’ in DNA to
disrupt replication.
Working with another learner or group of learners:
Discuss the use of drugs to treat life-threatening diseases, despite the side-effects that the drugs
themselves can cause.

24.1 What is a transition element?
The transition elements are found in the d block of the Periodic Table, between Groups 2 and 13. However,
not all d-block elements are classified as transition elements.

IMPORTANT
A transition element is a d-block element that forms one or more stable ions with an incomplete d subshell.
We do not define scandium (Sc) and zinc (Zn) as transition elements.
Scandium, with the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d1 4s2, forms only one ion, Sc3+. This 3+ ion has no
electrons in its 3d sub-shell: the electronic configuration of Sc3+ is just its argon core, [Ar].
Zinc, with the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s2, forms only one ion, Zn2+. This 2+ ion has a
complete 3d sub-shell: the electronic configuration of Zn2+ is [Ar] 3d10.
So neither scandium nor zinc forms an ion with an incomplete d sub-shell.
In this chapter we will be looking at the transition elements in the first row of the d block. These are the
metals titanium (Ti) through to copper (Cu), according to the definition above.

Electronic configurations
Atoms of transition elements
Table 24.1 shows the electronic configurations of the atoms in the first row of the transition elements. In
atoms of the transition elements, the 4s sub-shell is normally filled and the rest of the electrons occupy
orbitals in the 3d sub-shell. However, chromium and copper atoms are the exceptions.
Chromium atoms have just one electron in the 4s sub-shell. The remaining five electrons are arranged in
the 3d sub-shell so that each of its five orbitals is occupied by one electron.
Copper atoms also have just one electron in the 4s sub-shell. The remaining ten electrons are arranged in
the 3d sub-shell so that each orbital is filled by two electrons.

Ions of transition elements
The transition elements are all metals. In common with all metals, their atoms tend to lose electrons so
they form positively charged ions. However, each transition metal can form more than one positive ion. For
example, the common ions of copper are Cu+ and Cu2+. We say that the transition metals have variable
oxidation states. The resulting ions are often different colours.

Look at the ions of vanadium in their different oxidation states (Figure 24.2).

Figure 24.2: Vanadium and its oxidation states: a a solution containing VO2+ ions, b a solution containing VO2+ ions, c a
solution containing V3+ ions, d a solution containing V2+ ions.

Table 24.2: Common oxidation states of the transition elements.

It is the similarity in the energy of the 3d and 4s atomic orbitals that make these variable oxidation
numbers possible. Because there are variable oxidation states, the names of compounds containing
transition elements must have their oxidation number included, e.g. manganese(IV) oxide, MnO2, and
cobalt(II) chloride, CoCl2.

IMPORTANT
When transition elements form ions, their atoms lose electrons from the 4s sub-shell first, followed by
3d electrons.
Notice the partially filled d sub-shells in the following examples of ions (see definition of transition element
earlier in this section):
V atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3 4s2
→ V3+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s0
Fe atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6 4s2
→ Fe3+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s0
Cu atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s1
→ Cu2+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d9 4s0
The most common oxidation state is +2, usually formed when the atom of a transition element loses its

two 4s electrons.
The maximum oxidation number of the transition elements at the start of the row involves all the 4s and 3d
electrons in the atoms. For example, vanadium’s maximum oxidation state is +5, involving its two 4s
electrons and its three 3d electrons.
At the end of the row, from iron onwards, the +2 oxidation state becomes most common as 3d electrons
become increasingly harder to remove as the nuclear charge increases across the period.
The higher oxidation states of the transition elements are found in complex ions or in compounds formed
with oxygen or fluorine. Common examples are the chromate(VI) ion, CrO42−, and the manganate(VII) ion,
MnO4−.

24.2 Physical and chemical properties of the
transition elements
The transition elements commonly have physical properties that are typical of most metals:
they have high melting points
they have high densities
they are hard and rigid, and so are useful as construction materials
they are good conductors of electricity and heat
they have variable oxidation states
they behave as catalysts
they form complex ions (see Section 24.1)
they form coloured ions (see Section 24.1).

Redox reactions
We have seen how the transition elements can exist in various oxidation states. When a compound of a
transition element is treated with a suitable reagent, the oxidation state of the transition element can
change in the reaction.
Whenever a reaction involves reactants that change their oxidation states, the reaction is a redox reaction.
Redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons. Remember that a species (atom, molecule or ion) is
reduced when its oxidation state is reduced. The oxidation state changes to a lower value. An oxidation
state is lowered when a species gains electrons, and, when it is being reduced, it acts as an oxidising
agent.

Example 1
In the half-equation:

Fe3+ has been reduced to Fe2+ by gaining one electron. In the equation above, Fe3+ is acting as an
oxidising agent, an electron acceptor.
For this reaction to happen, another half-equation is needed in which the reactant loses one or more
electrons. The full reaction needs a reducing agent, an electron donor.

In Chapter 20 we saw how we can use standard electrode potential values, E⦵, to predict whether or not
such reactions could possibly take place.
Another half-equation we could consider combining with the reduction of Fe3+ half-equation is:

Here the MnO4− ion is also acting as an oxidising agent, an electron acceptor.
Both half-equations are written below as they appear in tables of data showing standard electrode
potentials:
Fe3+(aq) + e−

→ Fe2+(aq)

MnO4−(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e−
→ Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)

E⦵ = +0.77 V

E⦵ = +1.52 V

So the question is: Can Fe3+ ions oxidise Mn2+ to MnO4− ions, or can MnO4− ions in acid solution oxidise
Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions? In other words, which is the more powerful oxidising agent, Fe3+ ions or MnO4−
ions?

The magnitude of the positive values provides a measure of the tendency of the half-equations to proceed
to the right-hand side. The values show us that MnO4−(aq) is more likely to accept electrons and proceed in
the forward direction, changing to Mn2+(aq), than Fe3+(aq) is to accept electrons and change to Fe2+(aq).
MnO4−(aq) is a more powerful oxidising agent than Fe3+(aq). Therefore, MnO4−(aq) ions are capable of
oxidising Fe2+(aq) ions to form Fe3+(aq). So the top half-equation proceeds in the reverse direction.
We can now combine the two half-cells to get the overall reaction. Note that the sign of the Fe3+ / Fe2+ halfcell has changed by reversing its direction. The Fe2+ / Fe3+ equation also has to be multiplied by 5 so that
the electrons on either side of the equation cancel out when we add the half-equations together. This does
not affect the value of E⦵.
Combining the two half-equations:
⦵

⦵

⦵

The relatively large positive value of E⦵ (+0.75 V) tells us that the reaction is likely to proceed in the
forward direction as written.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 24.1
Redox titration
We can use the reaction above to calculate the amount of iron (Fe2+ ions) in a sample, such as an iron
tablet, by carrying out a titration.
A known volume (e.g. 25 cm3) of an unknown concentration of Fe2+(aq) is placed in a conical flask.
A solution of a known concentration of potassium manganate(VII) is put in a burette.
The potassium manganate(VII) solution is titrated against the solution containing Fe2+(aq) in the
conical flask.
During the reaction of MnO4−(aq) with Fe2+(aq) in the flask, the purple colour of the manganate(VII)
ions is removed. The end-point is reached when the Fe2+(aq) ions have all reacted and the first
permanent purple colour appears in the conical flask. This is when the MnO4−(aq) ions become in
excess in the reaction mixture (Figure 24.3).

Figure 24.3: Manganate(VII) ions can be used to determine the percentage of Fe2+ in an iron tablet.

You can achieve a more accurate result for the mass of Fe2+ in a solution by using dichromate(VI) ions,
Cr2O72−(aq), to oxidise it in a titration. This is because compounds such as potassium dichromate(VI) can
be prepared to a higher degree of purity than potassium manganate(VII). In a titration with Fe2+(aq) and
dichromate(VI), we need an indicator of the end-point that will be oxidised as soon as the Fe2+(aq) has all
reacted.
The half-equation and value for E⦵ for the use of dichromate as an oxidising agent is:
Cr2O72−(aq) + 14H+(aq) + 6e−
→ 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)

E⦵ = +1.33 V

WORKED EXAMPLE
1

0.420 g of iron ore were dissolved in acid, so that all of the iron present in the original ore was then
present as Fe2+(aq). The solution obtained was titrated against 0.0400 mol dm−3 KMnO4(aq). The
titre was 23.50 cm3.
a

Calculate the number of moles of MnO4− in the titre.
Solution to part a
Use the equation:
n=V×c
where n = number of moles, V = volume of solution in dm3 and c = concentration.

b

Calculate the number of moles of Fe2+ in the solution.
Solution to part b
The equation for the reaction in the titration is:
5Fe2+ + MnO4− + 8H+ → 5Fe3+ + Mn2+ + 4H2O(l)

c

Calculate the mass of iron in the solution (Ar of iron is 55.8).
Solution to part c
moles of Fe = moles of Fe2+ = 0.004 70 mol

d

Calculate the percentage mass of iron in the 0.420 g of iron ore.
Solution to part d

Example 2
Another example of a redox titration is the reaction of manganate(VII) ions with ethanedioate ions, C2O42−.
The ethanedioate ion is derived from ethanedioic acid, formerly known as oxalic acid. The ethanedioate
ions can be oxidised by potassium manganate(VII) in an acidic solution. A similar titration to the one above
can be carried out to find the unknown concentration of ethanedioate ions (toxic) in a solution or to
standardise potassium manganate(VII) solution (when the sodium ethanedioate solution needs to be
warmed before titrating).

The half-equation for the oxidation of ethanedioate ions is:

As we have just seen, the reduction of manganate(VII) ions to manganese(II) is:

Combining the two half-equations to get the full redox equation we need to multiply the ethanedioate ions
half-equation by 5, and multiply the manganate(VII) half-equation by 2. This will ensure that the 10
electrons cancel out on either side of the full equation:
Combining the two half-equations we get the full redox equation:

Note from the redox equation that, in a titration calculation, the manganate(VII) ion reacts with the
ethanedioate ion in the ratio 2 : 5.
This reaction is an example of autocatalysis, as the Mn2+(aq) ions formed act as a catalyst for reaction. The
transition elements and their ions can act as catalysts because they can vary their oxidation state in the
course of a reaction, accepting or losing electrons, and then reverting back to their original state. They can
also accept pairs of electrons into vacant d orbitals forming dative bonds with ligands.

Example 3
In this final redox example, we can consider the reaction of copper(II) ions with iodide ions in aqueous
solution. We can add the two half-equations together if we multiply the Cu2+ / Cu+ half-equation by 2 in
order to cancel out the electrons:

If we add excess iodide ions to a solution of Cu2+(aq) ions, we get iodine forming in solution and a
precipitate of copper(I) iodide:
2Cu2+(aq) + 4I−(aq) → 2CuI(s) + I2(aq)

equation 1

We can use this reaction to find the concentration of copper(II) ions in a solution. The formation of iodine in
the reaction mixture means that we can use starch indicator to judge an accurate end-point in a titration
experiment.
With excess iodide ions added to the copper(II) solution, we can add sodium thiosulfate solution of a known
concentration from a burette to the reaction mixture in a flask. The aqueous iodine, I2(aq), formed in the
reaction mixture reacts with the thiosulfate ions added:
I2(aq) + 2S2O32−(aq) → 2I−(aq) + S4O62−(aq)

equation 2

The brownish colour of the solution gets lighter as the iodine is used up. Now we can add the starch
solution, which turns blue / black with the remaining I2(aq) in the flask, to help us get a sharp end-point.
Then titrate slowly until the blue / black colour disappears when all the iodine has reacted, noting the
reading on the burette.
So, knowing the number of moles of thiosulfate ions added in the titration, from equation 2 we can deduce
that half that number of moles of I2(aq) must have been formed in equation 1. So, the number of moles of
Cu2+(aq) that we started with in equation 1 must be twice that of the I2(aq), i.e. the same number of moles
as the thiosulfate ions added in the titration. From this we can calculate the concentration of the Cu2+(aq)
ions in the initial copper(II) solution (i.e. the number of moles in 1 dm3 or 1000 cm3).

WORKED EXAMPLE
2 A 25.00 cm3 of copper(II) sulfate solution of unknown concentration reacted with excess potassium
iodide solution. The reaction mixture was then titrated against 0.0850 mol dm−3 sodium thiosulfate
solution, using a starch indicator. The titre was 15.40 cm3 when the blue / black colour disappeared.
Calculate the concentration of the copper(II) sulfate solution.
Solution
First, calculate the number of moles of thiosulfate ions, S2O32−(aq), in the titre.
Use the equation:
n=V×c
where n = number of moles, V = volume of solution in dm3 and c = concentration.
n=

× 0.0850 mol of thiosulfate ions

Working backwards from the two equations (as explained above this worked example):
2Cu2+(aq) + 4I−(aq) → 2CuI(s) + I2(aq)
I2(aq) + 2S2O32−(aq) → 2I−(aq) + S4O62−(aq)
we can deduce that the number of moles of copper(II) ions in the original solution is the same as the
number of moles of thiosulfate ions in the titre
i.e.

× 0.0850 mol

Therefore, we can calculate the concentration (c) of the 25.00 cm3 of copper(II) sulfate solution by
re-arranging the equation n = V × c to

24.3 Ligands and complex formation
In the section above on redox reactions, we learned about the oxidation of Fe2+(aq) ions. When these ions
are in solution the Fe2+ ion is surrounded by six water molecules. Each water molecule bonds to the central
Fe2+ ion by forming a dative (co-ordinate) bond from the oxygen atom into vacant orbitals on the Fe2+ ion
(Figure 24.4). The water molecules are called ligands and the resulting ion is called a complex ion. Its
formula is written as [Fe(H2O)6]2+. The shape of a complex with six ligands is octahedral.

Figure 24.4: [Fe(H2O)6]2+; the complex ion formed between an Fe2+ ion and six water molecules. It is called a
hexaaquairon(II) ion.

All ligands can donate an electron pair to a central transition metal ion. The co-ordination number of a
complex is the number of co-ordinate (dative) bonds to the central metal ion.
Some ligands can form two co-ordinate (dative) bonds from each ion or molecule to the transition metal
ion. These are called bidentate ligands, as shown in Figure 24.6. Most ligands, such as water and
ammonia, form just one co-ordinate (dative) bond and are called monodentate ligands.

Figure 24.5: The complex ion formed between a transition metal ion and a larger ligand can only fit four, not six, ligands
around the central ion. These are arranged in either a square planar shape (as in a [Ni(CN)4]2−) or a tetrahedral shape (as
in b [CoCl4]2−).

Figure 24.6: [Co(en)3]2+ is an example of a complex ion containing the bidentate ligand NH2CH2CH2NH2 (abbreviated to
‘en’). Another common bidentate ligand is the ethanedioate ion, C2O42− (abbreviated to ‘ox’) e.g. in [Fe(ox)3]3.

Table 24.3 shows some common ligands. Note that the charge on a complex is simply the sum of the
charges on the central metal ion and on each ligand in the complex. Some complexes will carry no charge,
e.g. Cu(OH)2(H2O)4.
EDTA4− ions can act as ligands. A single EDTA4− ion can form six co-ordinate bonds to a central transition
metal ion to form an octahedral complex. It is an example of a polydentate ligand called a hexadentate
ligand.

Stereoisomerism in transition metal complexes
In Chapter 14 we learned about two types of stereoisomerism: geometric and optical isomerism.
The presence of a double bond in 1,2-dibromoethene means that two geometrical isomers (cis/trans
isomers) are possible. Geometric isomerism is also possible in transition metal complexes, where no double
bond exists. In this case, the term ‘geometric isomerism’ refers to complexes with the same molecular
formula but different geometrical arrangements of their atoms. Examples are any square planar complexes
with the general formula [M(A)2(B)2], where M is the transition element, and A and B are its surrounding
ligands. Cis- and trans-platin are geometric isomers (Figure 24.8). In cis-platin, the chlorine atoms are next
to each other in the square complex but in trans-platin, they are diagonally opposite.

Figure 24.8: The geometrical isomers, cis-platin and trans-platin.

Cis-platin has been used as an anti-cancer drug. It acts by binding to sections of the DNA in cancer cells,
preventing cell division (see the ‘Fighting cancer’ section at the start of Chapter 24). Trans-platin does not
have the same beneficial medical effects.
The properties of geometrical isomers can be different. Differences in electronegativity of the atoms in
ligands forming the dative bonds to the central transition metal ion can result in polar and non-polar
complexes. For example, the cis-isomer will have two identiical groups on one side of any square planar
complex. So any difference in electronegativity between the two pairs of isomers will cause an imbalance
of charge, making a polar complex. The atoms with the higher electronegativity have a stronger pull on the
electrons in the dative bonds and will carry a partial negative charge. However, the trans-isomer will have
identical ligands directly opposite each other at the corners of the square planar complex. So the pull on
the electrons in the dative bonds to the central metal ion are perfectly balanced. This means that the
charge is balanced and results in a non-polar complex.
Octadedral complexes, with the general formula [M(A)4(B)2], can also display geometric isomerism. An
example is the cobalt(II) complex ion, [Co(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+ (see Figure 24.9).

Figure 24.9: The cis- and trans- isomers of [Co(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+

Again, the cis-isomer is a slightly polar complex, whereas the trans-isomer is non-polar. The imbalance of
charge in cis-isomer results from the asymmetric shape of the cis-[Co(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+ isomer and the
difference in electronegativity between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms bonded to the central cobalt(II).
The side of the complex with the water ligands will be partially negative as oxygen is more electronegative
than the nitrogen in the ammonia ligands. The differences in electronegativity still apply in the trans[Co(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+ isomer but its symmetical arrangement ensures the charge in the complex is spread
evenly around the complex.
Stereoisomerism is also commonly shown by octahedral (six co-ordinate) complexes associated with
bidentate ligands. An example is the complex containing nickel as the transition metal and 1,2-

diaminoethane (NH2CH2CH2NH2) as the bidentate ligand (Figure 24.10). The two isomers are stereoisomers
because the two different molecules are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed. They
are optical isomers, differing only in their ability to rotate the plane of polarised light in opposite directions.

Figure 24.10: The two non-superimposable optical isomers of [Ni(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3]2+: a the full structure, b a simplified
structure with ‘en’ representing a molecule of 1,2-diaminoethane.

The complex ion consisting of nickel(II) bonded to two bidentate 1,2-diaminoethane (en) ligands and two
monodentate ligands, such as water or chloride ions, can form both geometric (cis/trans) isomers and
optical isomers. Look at the cis- and trans-isomers of [Ni(H2NCH2CH2NH2)2(H2O)2]2+ in Figure 24.11,
simplified to [Ni(en)2(H2O)2]2+.

Figure 24.11: The geometric, cis- and trans- isomers of [Ni(H2NCH2CH2NH2)2(H2O)2]2+

Of the two cis- and trans- isomers of [Ni(en)2(H2O)2]2+ only the cis- isomer is optically active, with its two
non-superimposable mirror images. The symmetrical nature of the trans-isomers of [Ni(en)2(H2O)2]2+
means that its mirror images can be superimposed so they do not display optical isomerism. Look at the
optical isomers of [Ni(en)2(H2O)2]2+ in Figure 24.12.

Substitution of ligands
Copper complexes
The ligands in a complex can be exchanged, wholly or partially, for other ligands. This is a type of
substitution reaction. It happens if the new complex formed is more stable than the original complex.
The complexes of copper(II) ions can be used to show ligand substitution reactions, also called ligand
exchange reactions.
Whenever we write Cu2+(aq) we are really referring to the complex ion [Cu(H2O)6]2+. This ion gives a
solution of copper sulfate its blue colour. On adding sodium hydroxide solution, we see a light blue
precipitate forming.
Two water ligands are replaced by two hydroxide ligands in the reaction:

If you now add concentrated ammonia solution, the pale blue precipitate dissolves and we get a deep blue
solution:

The first reaction can also be achieved by adding concentrated ammonia solution to copper sulfate solution
drop by drop or by adding a dilute solution of ammonia. The pale blue precipitate formed will then dissolve
and form the deep blue solution when excess ammonia is added. The structure of [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+(aq)
is shown in Figure 24.13.

Figure 24.13: The octagonal structure of [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+(aq)

Water ligands in [Cu(H2O)6]2+ can also be exchanged for chloride ligands if we add concentrated
hydrochloric acid drop by drop. A yellow solution forms, containing the complex ion [CuCl4]2− :

The mixture of blue and yellow solutions in the reaction mixture gives it a greenish colour (Figure 24.14).

Figure 24.14: The equations for the changes are:
[Cu(H2O)6]2+ + 4Cl− ⇌ [CuCl4]2− + 6H2O
[Cu(H2O)6]2+ + 4NH3 ⇌ [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+ + 4H2O

Cobalt complexes
Aqueous cobalt(II) compounds also form complex ions. Whenever we write Co2+(aq), we are referring to the
complex ion [Co(H2O)6]2+. This ion gives an aqueous solution of cobalt(II) sulfate its pink colour. On adding
sodium hydroxide solution, we see a blue precipitate of cobalt(II) hydroxide forming, which turns red when
warmed if the alkali is in excess.

Water ligands in [Co(H2O)6]2+ can also be exchanged for ammonia ligands if we add concentrated aqueous
ammonia drop by drop.

The brown cobalt(II) complex ion is oxidised by oxygen in the air to [Co(NH3)6]3+(aq), a cobalt(III) complex
ion.
Adding concentrated hydrochloric acid drop by drop to an aqueous solution of cobalt(II) ions results in the
formation of a blue solution containing the tetrahedral complex [CoCl4]2−(aq).

Aqueous cobalt(II) ions usually form tetrahedral complexes with monodentate anionic ligands such as Cl−,
SCN− and OH−.

that another learner could follow.

incorrect.

Figure 24.15: A positive test for the presence of water using anhydrous cobalt chloride paper.

Stability constants
Aqueous solutions of transition element ions are hydrated. They are complex ions with water molecules
acting as ligands, forming dative (coordinate) bonds to the central metal ion.
Different ligands form complexes with different stabilities. For example, when we add concentrated

aqueous ammonia to an aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate, the ammonia ligands displace water ligands
in a stepwise process.
[Cu(H2O)6]2+(aq) + NH3(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH3)(H2O)5]2+(aq) + H2O(l)
[Cu(NH3)(H2O)5]2+(aq) + NH3(aq) ⇌ [Cu(NH3)2(H2O)4]2+(aq) + H2O(l)
As we increase the concentration of ammonia, this process continues until four of the water molecules are
replaced by ammonia molecules. The solution formed is a deep blue colour. The overall ligand substitution
reaction is:

We can think of this exchange of ligands in terms of competing equilibria of the forward and backward
reactions. The position of equilibrium lies in the direction of the more stable complex. In this case, the
complex with ammonia as a ligand is more stable than the complex with just water as a ligand. If we dilute
the complex with water, the position of equilibrium shifts to the left and a complex with more water
molecules as ligands forms.
The stability of the complex is expressed in terms of the equilibrium constants for ligand displacement.
This is called the stability constant. Usually an overall stability constant, Kstab, is given rather than the
stepwise constants. The method for writing equilibrium expressions for stability constants is similar to the
one we used for writing Kc (see Section 21.1). So for the equilibrium:
[Cu(H2O)6]2+ + 4Cl−(aq) ⇌ [CuCl4]2−(aq) + 6H2O(l)
the expression for the stability constant is:

Note:
water does not appear in the equilibrium expression because it is in such a large excess that its
concentration is regarded as being constant
the units for the stability constant are worked out in the same way as for the units of Kc (see Section
8.3). For example, in the above case:

Stability constants are often given on a log10 scale. When expressed on a log10 scale, they have no units
(see Table 24.4).
Stability constants can be used to compare the stability of any two ligands. The values quoted usually give
the stability of the complex relative to the aqueous ion where the ligand is water.

IMPORTANT
The higher the value of the stability constant, the more stable the complex.
Table 24.4 gives some values of stability constants for various copper(II) complexes relative to their
aqueous ions.

Table 24.4: The stability constants of some complexes of copper.

From Table 24.4 you can see that, in general, complexes with bidentate ions (2-hydroxybenzoate and 1,2dihydroxybenzene) have higher stability constants than those with monodentate ligands.
We can use the values of the stability constants to predict the effect of adding different ligands to complex
ions. For example, the addition of excess ammonia to the complex [CuCl4]2−(aq) should result in the
formation of a dark blue solution of the ammonia complex. That is because the stability constant of the
ammonia complex is higher than that of the chloride complex. The position of equilibrium is shifted to the
right in the direction of the more stable complex.
Addition of excess 1,2-dihydroxybenzene to the dark blue ammonia complex results in the formation of a
green complex with 1,2-dihydroxybenzene. This is because the stability constant with the 1,2dihydroxybenzene is much higher than that for ammonia. You can see from Table 24.4 that the log of Kstab
for 1,2-dihydroxybenzene is 25.0, so the actual value of Kstab is 10 raised to the power 25, compared to the
actual value for ammonia of 10 raised to the power 13.1. This shows that the copper complex with 1.2dihydroxybenzene is much more stable than the complex ion formed with ammonia. These values of Kstab
predict that there will be hardly any of the copper complex with ammonia left in the equilibrium mixture
shown in the equation below:

WORKED EXAMPLE
3

When concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to copper(II) sulfate solution, the aqueous solution
formed contains [CuCl4]2− and [Cu(H2O)4]2+ complex ions.
a

Write the expression for the stability constant for [CuCl4]2− in an aqueous solution.
Solution
First of all write the chemical equation for the ligand exchange equilibrium mixture formed in
the reaction:
[Cu(H2O)4]2+(aq) + 4Cl−(aq) ⇌ [CuCl4]2−(aq) + 4H2O
Then write the expression for Kstab. (Remember that products go on the top line and reactants
on the bottom line in equilibrium expressions, and that H2O is not included)

b

Work out the units of Kstab for the expression in part a.
Solution
Substitute the unit of concentration (mol dm−3) into your equilibrium expression from part a in
this question. Then cancel out the units.

c

Using Table 24.4, explain the proportions of the two copper(II) complex ions present in the
equilibrium mixture.
Solution

As the value of log10Kstab for the chloride ion is given in the table as 5.6, this shows that the
actual value of Kstab is 10 raised to the power of 5.6 i.e. a very large number. This shows that
the concentration of products in the equilibrium expression, in this case the [CuCl4]2− ions, is
much greater than the concentration of the reactant [Cu(H2O)6]2+ ions.
d

When concentrated ammonia solution is added to copper(II) chloride, explain what you would
see happen, using Table 24.4.
Solution
As the Kstab value for the copper(II) complex with ammonia is a much larger value than that of
the complex with chloride ions, the ammonia molecules will displace the chloride ions from the
[CuCl4]2− complex, forming a more stable complex of [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+. This will turn the
(greenish) yellow solution of the chloride complex a deep blue colour.

e

The exchange of ligands occurs step-by-step as successive ligands are replaced. For example
the second step in the exchange of water ligands for chloride ion ligands is shown by this
equation:
[Cu(H2O)5Cl]+(aq) + Cl–(aq) ⇌ Cu(H2O)4Cl2(aq) + H2O(l)
It was found for this reaction that when a 0.15 mol dm−3 solution of the complex ion
[(Cu(H2O)5Cl]+ was mixed with 0.15 mol dm−3 hydrochloric acid, the equilibrium concentration
of the Cu(H2O)4Cl2(aq) complex was 0.10 mol dm−3.
i

Write an expression for the stability constant for this ligand exchange reaction.
Solution

ii Calculate the value for Kstab for the reaction giving the units.
Solution
Work out the concentration of each of the ions at equilibrium:

Then substitute the concentrations at equilibrium into the expression for Kstab in e i:

Now share and discuss your answers to Question 6 with another learner. Agree on a final set
of answers before checking them against the answers provided.

The colour of complexes
You will have now seen the striking colours of complexes containing transition metal ions. But how do these
colours arise?
White light is made up of all the colours of the visible spectrum. When a solution containing a transition
metal ion in a complex appears coloured, part of the visible spectrum is absorbed by the solution.
The colour we see is called the complementary colour, made up of light with frequencies not absorbed. For
example, copper(II) ions absorb light from the red end of the spectrum, so the complementary colour seen
is a pale blue (called cyan). Here is a list of complementary pairs of colours:
red

cyan

yellow

blue

green

magenta

You should be aware that mixing light of different frequencies does not produce the same colour as mixing
different colours of paint.
However, that still doesn’t explain why part of the spectrum is absorbed by transition metal ions. To answer
this question, we must look in more detail at the d orbitals in the ions (Figure 24.16).

Figure 24.16: The degenerate d orbitals in a transition metal atom.

The five d orbitals in an isolated transition metal atom or ion are described as degenerate orbitals,
meaning they are all at the same energy level.
In the presence of ligands, a transition metal ion is not isolated. The dative (or co-ordinate) bonding from
the ligands causes the five d orbitals in the transition metal ion to split into two sets. The two sets of
orbitals are described as non-degenerate orbitals as they are at slightly different energy levels (see
Figure 24.17).
In a complex with six ligands, the ligands are arranged in an octahedral shape around the central metal
ion. The lone pairs donated by the ligands into the transition metal ion repel electrons in the two
and
orbitals shown in Figure 24.17 more than those in the other three d orbitals. This happens because
these two d orbitals line up with the dative (co-ordinate) bonds in the complex’s octahedral shape. As the

electrons in the
and
orbitals are closer to the bonding electrons in the octahedral arrangement,
the repulsion between electrons increases. Therefore, the d orbitals are split, with these two d orbitals at a
slightly higher energy level than the dyz, dxz and dxy orbitals.
Look at the left-hand side of Figure 24.17.

Figure 24.17: The splitting of the 3d orbitals in the octahedral [Cu(H2O)6]2+ complex ion.

A Cu2+ ion has an electronic configuration of [Ar] 3d9. Figure 24.17 shows how the nine d electrons are
distributed between the non-degenerate orbitals formed in a complex with ligands. The difference in the
energy between the non-degenerate d orbitals is labelled ΔE.
ΔE corresponds to part of the visible spectrum of light. So, when light shines on the solution containing the
[Cu(H2O)6]2+ complex, an electron absorbs this amount of energy. It uses this energy to jump into the
higher of the two non-degenerate energy levels. In copper complexes, the rest of the visible spectrum that
passes through the solution makes it appear blue in colour.
The exact energy difference (ΔE) between the non-degenerate d orbitals in a transition metal ion is
affected by many factors. One of these factors is the identity of the ligands that surround the transition
metal ion. As you have seen, a solution containing [Cu(H2O)6]2+ is a light blue, whereas a solution
containing [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+ is a very deep shade of blue. The colour change arises because the
presence of the ammonia ligands causes the d orbitals to split by a different amount of energy. This means
that the size of ΔE changes and this results in a slightly different amount of energy being absorbed by
electrons jumping up to the higher orbitals. Therefore, a different colour is absorbed from visible light, so a
different colour is seen.
In tetrahedral complexes, such as [CoCl4]2−, the splitting of the d orbitals is different (Figure 24.18). The
bonding pairs of electrons from four ligands line up with the dyz, dxz and dxy orbitals of the transition metal
ion. Unlike the octahedral arrangement, the
and
orbitals in a tetrahedral complex lie between the
metal–ligand bonds. So there is less repulsion between electrons in
or
orbitals and the lone pairs
of bonding electrons donated by the ligands. Therefore, when the d orbitals split in this case, the
or
are at a lower, more stable energy level than the dyz, dxz and dxy orbitals.

complexes and redox reactions. What have you learned from the activity?

SUMMARY
Each of the transition elements forms at least one ion with a partially filled d orbital. They are metals with similar
physical and chemical properties.
When a transition element is oxidised, it loses electrons from the 4s sub-shell first and then the 3d sub-shell to form
a positively charged ion.
Transition elements can exist in several oxidation states.
Many reactions involving transition elements are redox reactions. Some redox reactions are used in titrations to
determine concentrations.
A ligand is a molecule or ion with one or more lone pairs of electrons available to donate to a transition metal ion.
Transition elements form complexes by combining with ligands. Ligands bond to transition metal ions by one or
more dative (co-ordinate) bonds.
Ligands can be exchanged for other ligands in a complex. This can result in a change of colour.
Some transition element complexes exist as geometrical (cis/trans) isomers, e.g. cis- and trans-platin; others,
especially those associated with bidentate ligands with co-ordination number 6, may exist as optical isomers.
Ligand exchange can be described in terms of competing equilibria.
The stability constant, Kstab, of a complex ion is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion in a
solvent from its constituent ions or molecules.
The higher the value of the stability constant, the more stable is the complex ion formed.
Transition metal compounds are often coloured because of d orbital splitting, caused by ligands.
The splitting is different in octahedral and tetrahedral complexes. Different ligands will split the d orbitals by
different amounts, resulting in differently coloured complexes.

BENZENE
Benzene is a colourless, volatile liquid that has been used by chemists since the 1800s. It works well
as a solvent for other organic compounds, but is immiscible (does not mix) with water.
At one time, chemists used it with few precautions. However, we know now that it is highly toxic, and
is described as a carcinogen (a cancer-causing agent). It is particularly hazardous as it can be
absorbed through the skin.
Experiments in the 19th century showed that the formula of benzene was C6H6. But the chemists
working around 1860 were still struggling to work out its structure.
Working as a pair, can you come up with a straight-chain structure for C6H6, with each carbon forming
four bonds and each hydrogen one bond?
It was at that time that a German chemist called Friedrich August Kekulé had a fortunate dream. As

you have just done, he was working the problem of benzene’s structure. He grew tired and dozed off
and dreamt that the benzene molecules were snakes! One of the snakes bit its own tail, forming a
circle. When Kekulé woke up, he claimed that his dream inspired him to propose the structure shown in
Figure 25.1

Figure 25.1: The Kekulé structure of benzene.

You can find out how later chemists developed Kekulé’s structure to match their observations in
Section 25.1.

Figure 25.2: This is a vanilla orchid. Its seed pods contain a substance called vanillin.

Compounds based on benzene are found widely in nature, such as vanillin in vanilla (Figure 25.2).
Vanillin molecules are based on a benzene ring, as represented by the hexagon with a circle inside in
the structure shown below. Vanillin is used to flavour foods such as ice cream and chocolate. Its
structure is:

Questions for discussion
Working with another learner or group of learners:
Carry out some research to find out how the dream of another chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev, led to
the design of the Periodic Table in 1869.
Suggest a theory about the way the human brain works to explain the role of dreams in scientific
discoveries.

25.1 The benzene ring
The ‘benzene ring’ is a particularly important functional group found in many organic compounds. A
benzene ring is a hexagon made of six carbon atoms bonded together in a particular way. Benzene rings
are found in many compounds that are commercially important: for example, as medicines, dyes and
plastics.
Organic hydrocarbons containing one or more benzene rings are called arenes. In general, compounds of
benzene are known as aryl compounds or aromatic compounds; an example is chlorobenzene, which is one
of the halogenoarenes.
As you read in the section above, in Kekulé’s structure the hexagonal ring contained three double C═C
bonds. This is reflected in benzene’s name, which has the same ending as the alkenes.
As chemists developed analytical techniques, however, they found out that the benzene molecule was a
planar, perfectly symmetrical molecule. Kekulé’s structure would suggest three shorter double C═C bonds
and three longer C─C single bonds in the ring. This would produce a distorted hexagonal shape, not the
perfect hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms in benzene’s actual molecules. Figure 25.3 shows how we
represent benzene’s skeletal formula.

Figure 25.3: The skeletal formula of benzene. It can also be used in displayed formulae of aryl compounds, as in the
figure below Figure 25.2, showing the structure of vanillin.

We can now measure actual bond lengths. This was impossible in the 19th century when Kekulé worked.
Table 25.1 shows that the bond length of the carbon–carbon bonds in benzene lies between the values for
C─C single bonds and C═C double bonds.
The chemistry of benzene also suggests that the Kekulé structure is incorrect. If there were three C═C
bonds in benzene it would undergo addition reactions in the same way as the alkenes (see Section 15.3).
However, this is not the case. For example, ethene will decolorise bromine water on mixing at room
temperature, but benzene needs much harsher conditions.

Table 25.1: Comparing bond lengths.

The actual structure of benzene can be explained by considering the bonding in the molecule. Each of the
six carbon atoms in the hexagonal ring is sp2 hybridised (see Section 4.5), sharing:
one pair of electrons with one of its neighbouring carbon atoms
one pair of electrons with its other neighbouring carbon atom
one pair of electrons with a hydrogen atom.
These are three σ (sigma) bonds. These covalent bonds are a pair of electrons found mainly between the
nuclei of the atoms bonded to each other. Each carbon atom with sp2 hybrised atomic orbitals forms three
σ bonds: so that leaves one electron spare on each of the six carbon atoms in benzene. Each carbon atom
contributes its one spare electron to a π (pi) bond (see Section 4.5).
However, the π bonds formed by benzene are not the same as the π bonds in an alkene C═C bond (see
Section 4.5). In an alkene, a π bond helps to bond one pair of carbon atoms to each other; but in benzene
six spare p orbital electrons are spread over all six carbon atoms in the hexagonal ring. The six electrons in
the π bonds are said to be delocalised.
The π bonding in benzene is formed by the overlap of carbon p atomic orbitals, one from each of the six

carbon atoms. To achieve maximum overlap, the benzene molecule must be planar. The lobes of the p
orbitals overlap to form a ring of delocalised electrons above and below the plane of the carbon atoms in
the benzene molecule. This is shown in Figure 25.4.

Figure 25.4: The π bonding in benzene. The three bond angles around each of the sp2 hybridised carbon atoms are 120°.

Naming aryl compounds
You saw how to name aryl compounds with alkyl side-chains in Section 14.3. Some aryl compounds have
functional groups that are substituted directly into the benzene ring in place of a hydrogen atom.
You need to know the names of the compounds in Table 25.2.

25.2 Reactions of arenes
Most reactions of benzene and other arenes maintain the highly stable delocalised ring of π bonding
electrons intact. This occurs by substituting an atom, or group of atoms, for one or more hydrogen atoms
attached to the benzene ring. Addition reactions into the benzene ring would disrupt the ‘aromatic
stabilisation’ achieved by the complete delocalisation in the ring. The initial attack is usually by an
electrophile, which is attracted to the high electron density around the benzene ring.

Electrophilic substitution with chlorine or bromine
Benzene will react with bromine in the presence of an anhydrous aluminium bromide catalyst. The
substitution reaction is:

At first sight, the electrophile that starts the attack on benzene is not obvious. The electrophile is created
when an aluminium bromide molecule polarises a bromine molecule. The Br2 molecule forms a dative (coordinate) bond with aluminium bromide by donating a lone pair of electrons from one of its bromine atoms
into an empty 3p orbital in the aluminium. This draws electrons from the other bromine atoms in the Br2
molecule, making it partially positive, and creating the electrophile.
We can think of the electrophile as a Br+ cation:

The Br+ cation and the ‘electron-rich’ benzene ring are attracted to each other, as the mechanism of
electrophilic substitution below shows. Remember that the curly arrows show the movement of a pair of
electrons:

A similar reaction happens when chlorine gas is bubbled through benzene at room temperature in the
presence of a catalyst, such as aluminium chloride. The products of this electrophilic substitution are
chlorobenzene and hydrogen chloride. The catalysts in these reactions, AlBr3 and AlCl3, are known as
halogen carriers.
When we halogenate methylbenzene or other alkylarenes, the halogen atom substitutes into the benzene
ring at positions 2 or 4. These positions are ‘activated’ by any electron-donating groups bonded directly to
the benzene ring (see Table 25.4 at the end of the chapter).
Other examples of benzene compounds that are activated in these positions are phenol (C6H5OH) and
phenylamine (C6H5NH2).
So when we react methylbenzene with chlorine gas, using an anhydrous aluminium chloride catalyst, two
products can be made:

If excess chlorine gas is bubbled through, we can form 2,4-dichloromethylbenzene, 2,6dichloromethylbenzene and 2,4,6-trichloromethylbenzene. (Remember that the 2 and 6 positions in
substituted arenes are equivalent.)
The carbon–halogen bond in halogenoarenes is stronger than the equivalent bond in a halogenoalkane,
making the halogenoarenes much less reactive. This is because one of the lone pairs on the halogen atom
overlaps slightly with the π bonding system in the benzene ring. This gives the carbon–halogen bond in a
halogenoarene a partial double bond character.
Notice that the methyl side-chain off the benzene ring is not affected under the conditions used in the
reaction above. However, we learned in Section 15.2 that chlorine will react with alkanes in the presence of
ultraviolet (UV) light or strong sunlight. This reaction of the alkanes is a free-radical substitution reaction.
So, if the chlorine gas is passed into boiling methylbenzene in the presence of UV light, the following
reaction takes place:

Note that there is no substitution into the benzene ring under these conditions.
In excess chlorine, eventually all three of the hydrogen atoms on the methyl side-chain will be replaced by
chlorine atoms.

Question

a

Write the equation for the reaction of chlorine with benzene in the presence of an aluminium
chloride catalyst.

b

Name this type of mechanism for the reaction in part a.

c

Draw the mechanism of the reaction in part a, with Cl+ as the attacking species and using curly
arrows to show the movement of electron pairs.

added to excess bromine at room temperature in the presence of aluminium bromide.

e

Suggest how the reaction in part d would differ if the methylbenzene and bromine were boiled in
the presence of UV light.

f

Name the mechanism of the reaction in part e.

Nitration of benzene
The nitration of benzene is another example of an electrophilic substitution. Nitration refers to the
introduction of the ─NO2 group into a molecule. In this reaction the electrophile is the NO2+ ion, known as
the nitronium ion (or nitryl cation). This is made from a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and
concentrated sulfuric acid:
HNO3 + 2H2SO4 → NO2+ + 2HSO4a− + H3O+
This ‘nitrating mixture’ is refluxed with benzene at between 25 °C and 60 °C to make nitrobenzene:

The mechanism of the electrophilic substitution in this nitration is:

In stage 1 in the mechanism, the electrophile, NO2+, is attracted to the high electron density of the π
bonding system in benzene. A pair of electrons from the benzene ring is donated to the nitrogen atom in
NO2+, and forms a new covalent bond. At this point, benzene’s delocalised ring of electrons is disrupted.
There are now four π bonding electrons and a positive charge spread over five carbon atoms.
However, the full delocalised ring is restored in stage 2 when the C─H bond breaks heterolytically (see
Section 14.7). Both electrons in the C─H covalent bond go into nitrobenzene’s π bonding system, and
hydrogen leaves as an H+ ion. There are now six electrons spread over the six carbon atoms, so the
chemical stability of the benzene ring is retained in this substitution reaction.
In order to predict the products of further substitution into the benzene ring of the nitrobenzene formed, we
must consider the ‘directing effect’ of the nitro group. Further nitration of the nitrobenzene produces 1,3dinitrobenzene and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. Unlike the electron-donating methyl group in methylbenzene
(which activates the 2 and 4 positions in the benzene ring), the ─NO2 group is electron-withdrawing. This
type of group (which includes ─COOH) deactivates the 2 and 4 positions in the benzene ring. Therefore,
when there is a nitro group bonded to the benzene ring, further substitutions are directed to the 3 and 5
positions (see Table 25.4 at the end of the chapter).

Question

Copy and complete the two equations below, which can both be used to show the nitration of
methylbenzene:

methylbenzene.

____+____

Draw the displayed formula of each compound.
b

Benzene also undergoes electrophilic substitution when refluxed with fuming sulfuric acid for
several hours. This is called sulfonation. The electrophile is the SO3 molecule and the product
formed is benzenesulfonic acid, C6H5SO3H.
i

Suggest which atom in the SO3 molecule accepts an electron pair in the mechanism of
sulfonation.

ii

Write an equation in the style of part a i for the sulfonation of benzene to form
benzenesulfonic acid.

Discuss and sketch with a partner the mechanism of sulfonation in part b above. If you get stuck, work
with another group before displaying your suggested mechanism.

Alkylation (or acylation) of benzene (Friedel–Crafts reactions)
Friedel–Crafts reactions, named after the chemists who first discovered them, are a third example of
electrophilic substitution into the benzene ring.
Sometimes chemists need to change the structure of an arene in order to make a new product. Examples

include the manufacture of detergents or the reactants needed to make plastics, such as
poly(phenylethene), commonly known as polystyrene. They can use a Friedel–Crafts reaction to substitute
a hydrogen in the benzene ring for an alkyl group, such as a methyl (─CH3) or an ethyl (─C2H5) group:

The same type of reaction can also be used to introduce an acyl group into a benzene ring. An acyl group
contains an alkyl group and a carbonyl (C═O) group:

IMPORTANT
Friedel–Crafts reactions result in the introduction of a side-chain into a benzene ring.
Friedel–Crafts reactions are also called alkylation or acylation reactions.
For example:

The mechanisms for Friedel–Crafts reactions involve attack on the benzene ring by an electrophile. In these
reactions, the electrophile carries a positive charge on a carbon atom, so there is attack by a carbocation.
The electrophile is formed by adding an aluminium chloride catalyst to:
a halogenoalkane, to make an alkylbenzene, or
an acyl chloride, to make an acylbenzene.
This creates the carbocation electrophile to attack the benzene in the first step of the two mechanisms
below.

In alkylation
The alkylation of benzene, substituting an alkyl chain into the benzene ring, can be described by this threestep mechanism:
Step 1:

The arrow between Cl and AlCl3 represents a coordinate (dative covalent) bond.
The carbocation electrophile made then attacks the benzene ring:
Step 2:

The aluminium chloride catalyst is regenerated in the final step:
Step 3:

Further alkylation of the benzene ring can take place as the reaction proceeds.

In acylation
The acylation of benzene, substituting an acyl group into the benzene ring, can be described by this threestep mechanism:
Step 1:

Again, the electrophile made then attacks the benzene ring:
Step 2:

Then the aluminium chloride catalyst is regenerated in the final step:
Step 3:

Oxidation of the side-chain in arenes
The presence of the benzene ring in an alkylarene, such as methylbenzene, can affect the characteristic
reactions of its alkyl side-chain. For example, alkanes are not usually oxidised by a chemical oxidising
agent such as potassium manganate(VII).
However, in alkylarenes, the alkane side-chain is oxidised to form a carboxylic acid. For example,
methylbenzene produces benzoic acid when refluxed with alkaline potassium manganate(VII), and then
acidified with dilute sulfuric acid:

Hydrogenation
Unusually, the hydrogenation reaction is similar to an alkene’s reaction with hydrogen. The unsaturated
alkene becomes saturated as an alkane is formed. The reaction is carried out by heating the alkene with
hydrogen gas and a nickel or platinum catalyst.
The same reaction takes place with benzene. The benzene is hydrogenated and is converted to
cyclohexane. With methylbenzene, the product is methylcyclohexane:

Phenol, C6H5OH, is a crystalline solid that melts at 43 °C. It is used to manufacture a wide range of
products (Figure 25.5). Its structure is:

Figure 25.5: Phenol and its derivatives are used to make a variety of consumer goods.

The melting point of phenol is relatively high for an aryl compound of its molecular mass because of
hydrogen bonding between its molecules. However, the large non-polar benzene ring makes phenol only
slightly soluble in water, as it disrupts hydrogen bonding with water molecules.
We can prepare phenol by reacting phenylamine, C6H5NH2, with nitric(III) acid, HNO2, using ice to keep the
temperature below 10 °C. The reaction gives an unstable diazonium salt. We then warm the diazonium salt
in the aqueous solution to produce phenol. The equations are given below.
Prepare nitric(III) acid (nitrous acid) in a test-tube, using sodium nitrate(III) and dilute hydrochloric acid:

Then add the phenylamine:

The diazonium salt formed is unstable and will decompose easily on warming with water, giving off
nitrogen gas, N2:
C6H5N2+Cl− + H2O → C6H5OH + HCl + N2
diazonium salt

phenol

You can read more about diazonium salts and their use in the dye industry in Chapter 27.

The acidity of phenol
Phenol is weakly acidic, losing an H+ ion from its hydroxyl group:

The position of this equilibrium lies well over to the left-hand side.
The strength of acids can be compared by looking at their pKa values. The values for phenol, water and
ethanol are shown in Table 25.3. Remember: the higher the value of pKa, the weaker the acid (see Section
21.3).

Table 25.3: Comparing the acidity of phenol, water and ethanol.

IMPORTANT
Phenol is a stronger acid than water and ethanol. Ethanol is less acidic than phenol and water.
We can explain the order of acidity by looking at the conjugate bases formed on the right-hand side of the
equations in Table 25.3. The phenoxide ion, C6H5O−(aq), has its negative charge spread over the whole ion
as one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom overlaps with the delocalised π bonding system in the benzene
ring.

This delocalisation reduces the charge density of the negative charge on the phenoxide ion compared with
OH−(aq) or C2H5O−(aq). Therefore H+(aq) ions are not as strongly attracted to the phenoxide ion as they
are to hydroxide or ethoxide ions. This makes phenoxide ions less likely to re-form the undissociated phenol
molecules than hydroxide ions are to form water molecules, and ethoxide ions are to form ethanol
molecules.
Alternatively, we can explain the greater acidity of phenol by saying that phenol ionises to form a more
stable negative ion than water or ethanol, with its charge spread out. This stability means that the
ionisation of phenol is more likely to happen. This results in the position of equilibrium in the phenol
equation in Table 25.3 lying further to the right-hand side: so a higher proportion of phenol molecules
donate an H+ ion than in the dissociation equations for water and ethanol.
Ethanol is a weaker acid than water because of the electron-donating alkyl (ethyl) group attached to the
oxygen atom in the ethoxide ion. This has the effect of concentrating more negative charge on this oxygen
atom, which more readily accepts an H+ ion. This explains why the position of equilibrium lies further to the
left-hand side, favouring the undissociated ethanol molecules.

25.4 Reactions of phenol
We can divide the reactions of phenol into those involving the hydroxyl group, ─OH, and those involving
substitution into the benzene ring.

Breaking of the O─H bond in phenol
Although phenol is only slightly soluble in water, it dissolves well in an alkaline solution. As you have just
learned, phenol is a weak acid so it will react with an alkali to give a salt plus water:

The salt formed, sodium phenoxide, is soluble in water.
Molten phenol reacts vigorously with sodium metal, giving off hydrogen gas and again forming sodium
phenoxide:

Substitution into the benzene ring of phenol
Compared with benzene, phenol reacts more readily with electrophiles. The overlap of one of the lone pairs
of electrons on the oxygen atom in the ─OH group with the π bonding system increases the electron
density of the benzene ring in phenol. This makes phenol’s benzene ring more open to attack from
electron-deficient electrophiles than benzene itself. The electron-donating ─OH group ‘activates’ the
benzene ring, directing substitution to positions 2, 4 and 6 (see Table 25.4, at the end of this chapter).

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 25.1
Bromination of phenol
Phenol undergoes similar reactions to benzene, but phenol does so under milder conditions. For
example, bromine water will not react with benzene at room temperature. To produce bromobenzene
we need pure bromine (not a solution) and an aluminium bromide catalyst.
However, bromine water reacts readily with phenol. Phenol decolorises the orange bromine solution
and forms a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (see Figure 25.6).

Similar reactions happen between phenol and chlorine or iodine.

Figure 25.6: Bromine water is added to aqueous phenol from a dropper to form 2,4,6-tribromophenol.

This activation of the benzene ring is also shown in the nitration of phenol. With benzene, we need a
mixture of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid to reflux with benzene between 25 °C and 60 °C
for nitration to take place (see Section 25.2).
However, the activated ring in phenol readily undergoes nitration with dilute nitric acid at room
temperature:

If we use concentrated nitric acid, we get 2,4,6-trinitrophenol formed, shown below:

A phenolic compound
1-Naphthol is a compound closely related to phenol:

The electron donating ─OH group in 1-naphthol activates the benzene ring that it is bonded to. This makes
the ring more open to electrophilic substitution, directing attack to the 2 and/or 4 positions.

SUMMARY
The benzene molecule, C6H6, is symmetrical, with a planar hexagonal shape.
Arenes have considerable energetic stability because of the six delocalised π bonding electrons that lie above and
below the plane of the benzene ring.
The main mechanism for the reactions of arenes is electrophilic substitution. This enables arenes to retain their
delocalised π electrons. Hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring may be replaced by a variety of other atoms or
groups, including halogen atoms and nitro (─NO2) groups, as well as alkyl or acyl groups in Friedel–Crafts reactions.
Despite the name ending in -ene, arenes do not usually behave like alkenes. Arenes typically undergo electrophilic
substitution, whereas alkenes undergo electrophilic addition.
Sometimes the presence of the benzene ring affects the usual reactions of its side-chain, e.g. methylbenzene is
oxidised by refluxing with alkaline potassium manganate(VII) to form benzoic acid.
When the ─OH group is joined directly to a benzene ring, the resulting compound is called a phenol.
Phenols are weakly acidic, but are more acidic than water and alcohols. The acidity of phenol is due to
delocalisation of the negative charge on the phenoxide ion into the π bonding electron system on the benzene ring.
When reacted with sodium hydroxide, phenol forms a salt (sodium phenoxide) plus water. The reaction of sodium
metal with phenol produces sodium phenoxide and hydrogen gas.
The ─OH group enhances the reactivity of the benzene ring towards electrophiles. The ─OH group is said to activate
the benzene ring. For example, bromine water is decolorised by phenol at room temperature, producing a white
precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol.
Table 25.4 summarises the positions activated by different substituents in a benzene ring:
Substituent groups in the benzene ring that direct
the in-coming electrophile to attack the 2, 4 and / or
6 positions. These groups activate attack by
electrophiles (because they tend to donate electrons
into the benzene ring).

Substituent groups in the benzene ring that direct
the in-coming electrophile to attack the 3 and / or 5
positions. These groups de-activate attack by
electrophiles (because they tend to withdraw
electrons from the benzene ring).

TRANS-FATTY ACIDS
In general, when we get carboxylic acids from the hydrolysis of oils or fats, they are called ‘fatty acids’.
They usually contain an even number of carbon atoms and form unbranched chains (Figure 26.1). For
example, octadecanoic acid contains 18 carbon atoms. Its structural formula is CH3(CH2)16COOH. Its
skeletal formula is shown as:

Figure 26.1: The skeletal formula of a fatty acid.

We call fatty acids with one C═C double bond ‘monounsaturated’. We describe them as
‘polyunsaturated’ if they contain more than one C═C double bond. Each double bond will give rise to
cis/trans isomers (see Section 24.3).
Octadec-9-enoic acid is a common monounsaturated fatty acid we get from plant seeds. Its molecules
have eighteen carbon atoms and one C═C double bond. Figure 26.2 shows the skeletal formulae of its
cis- and trans-isomers.

Figure 26.2: The cis- and trans-isomers of octadec-9-enoic acid.

You can see that the trans-isomer has straight chains whereas the cis-isomer is bent. This means that
the trans-fatty acids can pack together better and so have the higher melting points.

Trans-fatty acids are associated with health risks due to their use in foodstuffs, such as biscuits and
pastry. Plant oils are turned into ‘spreadable’ margarines by heating the oils with hydrogen using a
nickel or platinum catalyst. This addition reaction saturates some of the double bonds, straightening
out the chains in their molecules. The hydrogenation process also converts cis-isomers into transisomers, which increases their melting points. Trans-fatty acids are particularly associated with fast
foods that are prepared by frying in these partially hydrogenated oils.
Researchers have found links between the amount of trans-fats consumed and an increased risk of
heart disease and strokes. The trans-fats appear to increase the amount of low-density lipoprotein
(LDLs) cholesterol (known as ‘bad’ cholesterol) and lowers the amount of high-density lipoproteins
(HDLs) the ‘good’ cholesterol associated with health benefits. Disturbing the balance in your blood
between LDLs and HDLs can result in arteries furring up and narrowing, causing circulatory problems.
This can result in high blood pressure, strokes and heart disease.

Questions for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners:
why do the makers of margarines often use trans-fatty acids to make their products?
how does consuming too much affect your body?
how can we reduce our intake of foods containing trans-fatty acids?

26.1 The acidity of carboxylic acids
Carboxylic acids display the typical reactions of all acids due to the presence of excess H+(aq) ions in their
aqueous solutions (see Section 21.3). For example, they react with bases to form a salt and water. Their
salts are called carboxylates. The carboxylate salt formed by the reaction of ethanoic acid with sodium
hydroxide is called sodium ethanoate, CH3COO−Na+.
The carboxylic acids are weak acids. The majority of their molecules are undissociated in water.
For example:

The position of this equilibrium lies well over to the left-hand side. The dissociation constant, Ka, of
ethanoic acid at 25 °C is 1.7 × 10−5 mol dm−3 (see Section 21.3).

IMPORTANT
Remember that the smaller the value of Ka, the weaker the acid.
The carboxylic acids are stronger acids than alcohols. This is explained by:
the O─H bond in the carboxylic acid is weakened by the carbonyl group, C=O.

The carboxylate ion is stabilised by the delocalisation of electrons around the ─COO− group. This
delocalisation spreads out the negative charge on the carboxylate ion, reducing its charge density. This
makes it less likely to bond with an H+(aq) ion to re-form the undissociated acid molecule with its
─COOH group.

As we have already seen in Section 25.3, phenol (C6H5OH) is a stronger acid than ethanol. However, phenol
(Ka = 1.0 × 1010 mol dm−3) is a weaker acid than ethanoic acid, CH3COOH (Ka = 1.7 × 10−5 mol dm−3) and
benzoic acid, C6H5COOH (Ka = 6.3 × 10−5 mol dm−3).

IMPORTANT
Carboxylic acids are stronger acids than phenols, and phenols are stronger acids than alcohols.
We find that electron-withdrawing groups bonded to the carbon atom next to the ─COOH group make the
acid stronger.
There are two reasons for this:
electron-withdrawing groups further weaken the O─H bond in the undissociated acid molecule
electron-withdrawing groups extend the delocalisation of the negative charge on the ─COO− group of
the carboxylate ion, further increasing the stabilisation of the ─COO− group, and making it less likely to
bond with an H+(aq) ion.
Chlorine atoms are an example of an electron-withdrawing group. The dissociation constants (Ka) of

ethanoic acid and its three chloro-substituted derivatives are shown in Table 26.2.
Acid

Ka at 25 °C / mol dm−3

ethanoic acid, CH3COOH

1.7 × 10−5

chloroethanoic acid, CH2ClCOOH

1.3 × 10−3

dichloroethanoic acid, CHCl2COOH

5.0 × 10−2

trichloroethanoic acid, CCl3COOH

2.3 × 10−1

Table 26.2: The larger the value of Ka, the stronger the acid.

Trichloroethanoic acid, CCl3COOH, has three strongly electronegative Cl atoms all withdrawing electrons
from the ─COOH group, weakening the O─H bond more than the other acids in Table 26.2. Once the O─H
bond is broken, the resulting anion is also stabilised more effectively as the negative charge is further
spread out by its three electron-withdrawing Cl atoms, making it less attractive to H+(aq) ions. This makes
the CCl3COOH the strongest of the acids listed in Table 26.2 as it has most Cl atoms (see Figure 26.3).

IMPORTANT
The more electron-withdrawing groups on the carbon atom bonded to the C atom in the –COOH group,
the stronger the acid.

Figure 26.3: The trend in the acid strength of ethanoic acid and its chloro-substituted derivatives.

Ethanoic acid is the weakest acid in Table 26.2, as the methyl group is electron donating. This has the
opposite effect to electron-withdrawing groups:
it strengthens the O─H bond in the acid’s ─COOH group
it donates negative charge towards the ─COO− group of the carboxylate ion, concentrating its negative
charge, and making it more likely to accept an H+(aq) ion.

Question
Working in a pair or a small group, discuss Question 1 below together before writing down your answers.

reasoning.

26.2 Oxidation of two carboxylic acids
You saw in Chapter 17 that primary alcohols can be oxidised by heating with acidified potassium
dichromate(VI) solution to form aldehydes and then further oxidation produces carboxylic acids (see
Section 18.2). The carboxylic acids prepared are not usually oxidised any further.
However, methanoic acid (HCOOH) is a stronger reducing agent than other carboxylic acids, so it can
undergo further oxidation (Figure 26.4).

Figure 26.4: The displayed formula of methanoic acid.

This involves the oxidising agent breaking down the methanoic acid molecule, forming carbon dioxide. This
oxidation can be carried out even by warming with mild oxidising agents, such as the Fehling’s or Tollens’
reagents used to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones (see Section 18.5).
In a positive test for an aldehyde, the Cu2+ ion in Fehling’s solution is reduced to the Cu+ ion, which
precipitates out as red copper(I) oxide. When methanoic acid is oxidised by Fehling’s solution, the same
positive test result is obtained. With Tollens’ reagent, the silver ion present, Ag+, is reduced to silver metal,
Ag, when it oxidises methanoic acid (also as in the positive test for an aldehyde).
The half-equation for the oxidation of methanoic acid can be written in terms of electron transfer to an
oxidising agent as:

or in terms of the addition of oxygen from an oxidising agent as:
HCOOH + [O] → CO2 + H2O
This oxidation of methanoic acid will also occur with stronger oxidising agents such as acidified solutions of
potassium manganate(VII) (decolorising the purple solution) or potassium dichromate(VI) (turning the
orange solution green).
Another common example of a carboxylic acid that can be oxidised by these stronger oxidising agents is
ethanedioic acid (a dicarboxylic acid). Its molecular formula is H2C2O4. Its structural formula is HOOCCOOH
or (COOH)2, and its displayed formula is shown in Figure 26.5.

Figure 26.5: The displayed formula of ethanedioic acid.

A solution of ethanedioic acid (with sulfuric acid added) can be used in titrations to standardise a solution
of potassium manganate(VII). As with methanoic acid, the oxidation results in the formation of carbon
dioxide and water. The solid ethanedioic acid can be weighed out accurately to make a standard solution of
known concentration. This is warmed in a conical flask and the potassium manganate(VII) solution to be
standardised is run in from a burette. The end-point of the titration is identified when the addition of a drop
of the purple manganate(VII) solution turns the solution pink. This happens when all the ethanedioic acid
has been oxidised.
The balanced ionic equation for this redox reaction is:
2MnO4− + 6H+ + 5H2C2O4 → 2Mn2+ + 10CO2 + 8H2O
The manganese(II) ions formed catalyse the reaction. This is an example of autocatalysis, in which one of
the products of the reaction acts as a catalyst for that reaction.

Question
2

a

Carboxylic acids can be prepared by refluxing a primary alcohol with a strong oxidising agent.
Why is methanoic acid never prepared by refluxing methanol with acidified potassium
dichromate(VI) solution?

b

Look back at the two half-equations for the oxidation of methanoic acid.
Write two similar equations representing the oxidation of ethanedioic acid.

c

i

In a titration between ethanedioic acid and potassium manganate(VII) solutions, ethanedioic
acid is heated in its conical flask before adding the potassium manganate(VII) solution from
the burette. Suggest why.

ii

In an experiment to standardise a solution of potassium manganate(VII), 25.0 cm3 of a
standard solution of 0.0500 mol dm−3 ethanedioic acid was fully oxidised by a titre of 8.65
cm3 of potassium manganate(VII) solution.
Calculate the concentration of the potassium manganate(VII) solution.

REFLECTION
This activity helps you to reflect on your understanding of redox reactions, half-equations and titration
calculations.
Discuss with a partner whether or not you both feel that you have a good understanding of redox
reactions, half-equations and titration calculations. Are you confident in all three areas or not? Think
about the skills and thought processes you need to master these areas. This will help you identify
where any problems lie.
If necessary, look back to Chapters 1, 7 and 24 to revise redox reactions, half-equations and titration
calculations. How will you use the skills and thought processes you discussed with your partner when
revising these chapters?

26.3 Acyl chlorides
Preparing acyl chlorides
An acyl chloride is similar in structure to a carboxylic acid but the hydroxyl group, ─OH, has been replaced
by a Cl atom. The displayed formula of ethanoyl chloride is shown in Figure 26.6.
The structural formula of ethanoyl chloride is written as CH3COCl.

Figure 26.6: Ethanoyl chloride is the acyl chloride derived from ethanoic acid.

We can prepare acyl chlorides from their corresponding carboxylic acid using solid phosphorus(V) chloride,
liquid phosphorus(III) chloride or liquid sulfur dichloride oxide (SOCl2).

With phosphorus(V) chloride
CH3COOH + PCl5 → CH3COCl + POCl3 + HCl
No special conditions are required for this reaction.

With phosphorus(III) chloride
3CH3COOH + PCl3 → 3CH3COCl + H3PO3
Heat is required for this reaction to take place.

With sulfur dichloride oxide
CH3COOH + SOCl2 → CH3COCl + SO2 + HCl
No special conditions are required for this reaction.
You can observe steamy white fumes when hydrogen chloride gas given off. The third reaction, with SOCl2,
is the one reaction to produce the acyl chloride as the only liquid product, as both SO2 and HCl are gases.

Question
3

Write a balanced equation, using structural formulae for the organic compounds, and state any
conditions necessary, to show the formation of:
a

propanoyl chloride from a suitable carboxylic acid and SOCl2

b

methanoyl chloride from a suitable carboxylic acid and PCl3

c

butanoyl chloride from a suitable carboxylic acid and PCl5.

Check your answers to Question 3 against those of another learner, making sure all your equations are
balanced, before looking at the answers provided.

Reactions of acyl chlorides
Many useful compounds can be synthesised from carboxylic acids. However, the synthetic reactions can be
difficult to carry out because carboxylic acids are relatively unreactive. One way round this is to first
convert the carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Acyl chlorides are much more reactive than carboxylic

acids.
As we saw in Section 18.2, an acyl chloride is similar in structure to a carboxylic acid, with the ─OH group
replaced by a Cl atom. So the ─COOH functional group becomes the ─COCl group. The structural formula of
acyl chlorides can be written as ROCl, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. For example, propanoyl chloride
can be written as CH3CH2COCl.
The structural formulae of benzoic acid and its derivative benzoyl chloride are shown in Figure 26.7.

Figure 26.7: Benzoyl chloride is the acyl chloride derived from benzoic acid.

Acyl chlorides are reactive compounds. The carbonyl carbon has electrons drawn away from it by the Cl
atom as well as by its O atom as both are strongly electronegative atoms. This gives the carbonyl carbon a
relatively large partial positive charge and makes it particularly open to attack from nucleophiles.
Remember that nucleophiles can donate a lone pair of electrons to an electron-deficient carbon atom in the
mechanism of a reaction.

The acyl chlorides are reactive liquids. When they react with nucleophiles the C─Cl bond breaks and white
fumes of hydrogen chloride, HCl, are given off.

IMPORTANT
To generalise the reactions of acyl chlorides, we can write:
ROCl + HZ → ROZ + HCl
where HZ can be water, an alcohol, phenols, ammonia or an amine.
Note that HZ contains either an oxygen or nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons that can be donated.
HZ can therefore act as a nucleophile.
Also note that in the reactions with ammonia and amines, the HCl gas formed reacts quickly with the
ammonia / amines to form salts. Ammonia will form NH4+Cl−, primary amines form RNH3+Cl− and
secondary amines form R2NH2+Cl−. This means that you see far less of the white HCl fumes given off than
with water, alcohols or phenols.

Reaction with water
Figure 26.8 shows the mechanism of hydrolysis, showing the initial attack by a water molecule, acting as a
nucleophile, followed by the elimination of a molecule of hydrogen chloride.

Figure 26.8: The condensation (addition–elimination) mechanism of hydrolysis of ethanoyl chloride.

The hydrolysis can be classified as a condensation reaction, as there is an initial addition reaction of water

across the C═O bond, followed by elimination of a small molecule, in this case HCl.
This reaction is far more vigorous than the hydrolysis of chloroalkanes (see Section 16.2). The hydrolysis of
chloroalkanes needs a strong alkali, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, to be refluxed with the
chloroalkane to hydrolyse it. The nucleophile needed to hydrolyse a chloroalkane is the negatively charged
hydroxide ion, OH−.
However, a neutral water molecule is sufficient to hydrolyse an acyl chloride quickly at room temperature.
This difference is due to the carbon bonded to the chlorine atom in a chloroalkane not being as strongly δ+
as the carbon atom in an acyl chloride. Remember that in an acyl chloride, the carbon bonded to the
chlorine atom is also attached to an oxygen atom. So the carbonyl carbon has two strongly electronegative
atoms pulling electrons away from it. Therefore, the attack by the nucleophile is much more rapid.
Aryl chlorides or chloroarenes, such as chlorobenzene, C6H5Cl, will not undergo hydrolysis. The carbon
atom bonded directly to the chlorine atom is part of the delocalised π bonding system of the benzene ring.
A lone pair of electrons from the Cl atom tends to overlap with the delocalised p electrons in the benzene
ring. This causes the C─Cl bond to have some double bond character, making it stronger and more difficult
to break, so hydrolysis does not occur.

IMPORTANT
The ease of hydrolysis, starting with the compounds most readily broken down, is:
acyl chloride > chloroalkane > aryl chloride or chloroarene

If a reaction occurs with water, what will you see in part i?

Reaction with alcohols and with phenol
When acyl chlorides react with alcohols and phenol they form esters (and HCl). The reactions happen more
quickly than the reactions of alcohols or phenol with carboxylic acids. The acyl chloride reactions also go to
completion and do not form an equilibrium mixture like the reactions with carboxylic acids. Therefore acyl
chlorides are useful in the synthesis of esters in the chemical industry.
Ethanoyl chloride will react vigorously with ethanol to form an ester:

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 26.1
Hydrolysis of acyl chlorides
Water is a suitable nucleophile to attack an acyl chloride molecule.
A lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom in a water molecule initiates the attack on the δ+ carbonyl
carbon atom. The reaction produces a carboxylic acid and hydrogen chloride gas. It is an example of a
hydrolysis reaction, i.e. the breakdown of a compound by water.

For example:

The acyl chloride can be added to water using a dropping pipette. The reaction is immediate and white
fumes of HCl are observed rising from the liquid.
With phenol, the reaction with an acyl chloride proceeds if warmed. There is no reaction between phenol
and carboxylic acids, so acyl chlorides must be used if you want to make phenyl esters. The reaction takes
place in the presence of a base. The initial reaction between phenol and the base creates the phenoxide
ion, C6H5O−. The negatively charged phenoxide ion acts as the nucleophile to attack the carbonyl carbon in
the acyl chloride:

Reaction with ammonia and amines
Ammonia (NH3) acts as the nucleophile in the usual nucleophilic addition–elimination reaction of acyl
chlorides. The concentrated ammonia is added at room temperature and the reaction is vigorous:

followed by:
HCl + NH3 → NH4+Cl−
The organic product is an amide (R─CONH2), in which the Cl atom in the acyl chloride is replaced by an
─NH2 group. The mechanism of the reaction with ammonia is shown in Figure 26.9:

Figure 26.9: Mechanism of the nucleophilic addition–elimination of an acyl chloride with ammonia.

Primary amines (R─NH2) can also act as nucleophiles as they contain nitrogen atoms with a lone pair of
electrons. This lone pair of electrons is available to attack the carbonyl carbon atom in acyl chlorides.
The reaction of an acyl chloride with an amine is vigorous and the organic product is a substituted amide.
For example, with a primary amine such as methylamine:

The mechanism of the nucleophilic condensation (addition–elimination) reactions of acyl chlorides with

amines follows the same steps as the hydrolysis with water in Figure 26.8 earlier in this section, and the
reaction with ammonia above (Figure 26.9). You can imagine the primary amine as an ammonia molecule
with one of its H atoms replaced by an alkyl group.
Look at Figure 26.10.

Figure 26.10: The nucleophilic condensation (addition–elimination) mechanism of ethanoyl chloride reacting with a
primary amine.

With secondary amines (R1R2NH), such as dimethylamine, the reaction is similar:

In both the reactions with amines shown above, most of the HCl is not given off as white fumes. As with
ammonia, most of the HCl undergoes an acid–base reaction with unreacted amine to form a white organic
ammonium salt. With methylamine, we get CH3NH3+Cl−, and with dimethylamine (CH3)2NH2+Cl− is formed.
For example:
CH3NH2 + HCl → CH3NH3+Cl−

SUMMARY
Carboxylic acids are weak acids. Their strength is increased if the carbon atom next to the —COOH group has
electron-withdrawing atoms, such as chlorine, bonded to it.
Acyl chlorides (RCOCl) are made by reacting carboxylic acids with PCl5, PCl3 or SOCl2.
Acyl chlorides react with amines to give substituted amides. Acyl chlorides are more reactive than their
corresponding carboxylic acids.
Acyl chlorides are reactive liquids. They are easily hydrolysed by water, forming a carboxylic acid while giving off
white fumes of hydrogen chloride.
Acyl chlorides also react with alcohols and phenols to give esters.
The ease of hydrolysis of chloro compounds is largely determined by the size of the partial positive charge on the
carbon in the C—Cl bond and its strength. So acyl chlorides are more reactive with water than alkyl chlorides
(halogenoalkanes), which are more reactive the hydrolysis-resistant aryl chlorides (halogenoarenes).

COLOURFUL CHEMISTRY
In 1856 William Henry Perkin was only 18 years old when he made a remarkable discovery – by
accident! William was studying chemistry and was given the task of making quinine, a drug used to
treat malaria. After one of his experiments with coal tar, his beaker was filled with a black sticky mess.
Another failure, he assumed. However, when he tried to wash the beaker with alcohol, he found that
the gooey mess dissolved to form a beautiful, rich purple-coloured solution.
Instead of disposing of the solution, he was so thrilled with the colour that he decided to dye a piece of
silk with it. When the silk was dry he found that the dye did not wash out in water, and the colour did
not fade in sunlight. Perkin had made the first synthetic dye.
After that he formed a company to market the new dye and continued his research to make more new
colours of dye.
Figure 27.1 shows what the main structure in the dye was later found to be.
Now we have thousands of synthetic dyes to choose from and the vast majority contain nitrogen
atoms, like the original synthetic dye. You can read more about ‘azo dyes’ and how we can prepare
them in Section 27.2. Figure 27.2 shows a few examples of azo dyes.

Figure 27.1: The skeletal formula of the main compound in William Perkin’s original synthetic dye (mauve).

rings, are found in all the structures?

Figure 27.2: The structures of differently coloured azo dyes.

27.1 Amines
Classes of amines
There are three classes of amine: primary, secondary and tertiary.

IMPORTANT
Primary amines have an ─NH2 group bonded to an alkyl or aryl group, e.g. ethylamine, C2H5NH2 (Figure
27.3), or phenylamine, C6H5NH2.
Note that some primary amines do not have the ─NH2 group at the end of an alkyl chain. We indicate the
position of the ─NH2 group on the hydrocarbon chain by numbering from the nearest end of the molecule.
In these cases we refer to the ─NH2 group as the ‘amino’ group, e.g. CH3CH2CH(NH2)CH2CH2CH3 is called 3aminohexane.

Figure 27.3: The displayed formulae and structural formulae of three primary amines.

IMPORTANT
Secondary amines have two alkyl or aryl groups attached to an >NH group, e.g. dimethylamine,
(CH3)2NH.
Look at the first formula in Figure 27.4. This shows dimethylamine, a secondary amine.

Figure 27.4: A secondary amine and a tertiary amine.

Tertiary amines have three alkyl or aryl groups attached to the same nitrogen atom, e.g. trimethylamine,
(CH3)3N (shown in Figure 27.4). However, at this level, we will only be looking at the reactions of primary
and secondary amines.

The basicity of amines

We can think of the amines as substituted ammonia (NH3) molecules. For example, a primary amine is an
ammonia molecule with one of its H atoms replaced by an alkyl or aryl group. Ammonia and the amines act
as bases because of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. Remember that a base is a proton (H+
ion) acceptor. The nitrogen atom donates its lone pair to an H+ ion, forming a co-ordinate (dative) bond.
For ammonia:
NH3 + H+ → NH4+
For a primary amine:
RNH2 + H+ → RNH3+
Dilute hydrochloric acid reacts with ammonia and with amines to produce salts.
For ammonia:
NH3 + HCl → NH4+Cl−
ammonium chloride
For a primary amine:
CH3NH2 + HCl → CH3NH3+Cl−
methylammonium chloride
Ammonia and the amines have different strengths as bases.

IMPORTANT
The strength of ammonia and amines as bases depends on the availability of the lone pair of electrons
on their N atom to bond with an H+ ion.

Let us consider ammonia, ethylamine and phenylamine as examples. We find that the strongest base of
the three is ethylamine, followed by ammonia and, finally, phenylamine.
Ethylamine is a stronger base than ammonia because the ethyl group is electron-donating: it has a positive
inductive effect (see Figure 27.5). By releasing electrons to the N atom, the ethyl group makes the lone pair
more readily available to bond with an H+ ion than it is in ammonia. Ammonia just has three H atoms
bonded to the N atom, and no alkyl groups.

Figure 27.5: Ethylamine is a stronger base than ammonia.

However, ammonia is a stronger base than phenylamine because one of the p orbitals on the nitrogen
atom in phenylamine overlaps with the π bonding system in the benzene ring. This causes the lone pair of
the N atom in phenylamine to be delocalised into the benzene ring. This then makes the lone pair less
available to form a co-ordinate (dative) bond with an H+ ion than it is in ammonia (see Figure 27.6).

Figure 27.6: Phenylamine is a very weak base.

Discuss and predict whether diethylamine is a stronger or weaker base than ethylamine. Explain
your reasoning.

27.2 Formation of amines
1 In Chapter 16 you learned how bromoethane undergoes nucleophilic substitution with ammonia to form
a mixture of amines. In order to prepare ethylamine (while avoiding the formation of secondary and
tertiary amines we use excess hot ethanolic ammonia under pressure:

Hydrogen bromide, HBr, which could react with the ethylamine, is removed by the excess ammonia. It
forms ammonium bromide, NH4Br. The excess ammonia also reduces the chances of bromoethane
being attacked by ethylamine, as ethylamine is also a nucleophile.
However, if your aim is to prepare a secondary amine, we can start with a halogenoalkane and a
primary amine and react them, again in ethanol, heated in a sealed tube, under pressure. For example:
CH3CH2NH2 + CH3CH2Br → (CH3CH2)2NH + HBr
The secondary amine formed in this example is named diethylamine.
2 We also learned in Chapter 16 about the formation of nitriles by reacting a halogenoalkane with the CN−
ion. To carry out the reaction, a solution of potassium cyanide, KCN, in ethanol is heated under reflux
with the halogenoalkane:

Note that we start with bromomethane, not bromoethane, as the cyanide group adds a carbon atom to
the alkyl group.
We can then reduce (add hydrogen to) the ethanenitrile to make ethylamine.
The nitrile vapour and hydrogen gas are passed over a nickel catalyst, or LiAlH4 (lithium
tetrahydridoaluminate) in dry ether can be used for the reduction:

3 We can also use LiAlH4 in dry ether to reduce amides to amines.
So the carbonyl group, >C═O, in the ethanamide will be reduced to ethylamine:

Preparing phenylamine
Phenylamine is made by reducing nitrobenzene. This reduction is carried out by heating nitrobenzene
under reflux with tin (Sn) and concentrated hydrochloric acid. The organic product in the acidic reaction
mixture is the ion C6H5N+H3, which is then converted to phenylamine, C6H5NH2, by adding sodium
hydroxide solution. The reduction can be summarised as:

The phenylamine is separated from the reaction mixture by steam distillation (Figure 27.7).

Figure 27.7: Steam generated in the conical flask is passed into the reaction mixture in the pear-shaped flask and
phenylamine is distilled off and collected.

checking against the answers provided.

Reactions of phenylamine
Phenylamine with aqueous bromine
The reaction of aqueous bromine with phenylamine is similar to the reaction of aqueous bromine with
phenol (see Section 25.4): a white precipitate is formed. The nitrogen in the ─NH2 group in phenylamine
has a lone pair of electrons that can be delocalised into the benzene ring so that the π bonding system
extends to include the C─N bond. The extra electron density in the benzene ring makes it more readily
attacked by electrophiles. Remember that the 2, 4 and 6 positions around the benzene ring are activated
when electron-donating groups, such as ─NH2 or ─OH, are attached to the ring:

Using phenylamine to make dyes
Phenylamine is an important compound in the synthesis of dyes.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 27.1
Making an azo dye
The first step in making an azo dye is the reaction between phenylamine and nitric(III) acid (nitrous

acid), HNO2, to give a diazonium salt.
Nitric(III) acid is unstable, so it has to be made in the test-tube. Then the phenylamine is added. We
can make the nitric(III) acid using sodium nitrate(III) (sodium nitrite), NaNO2, and dilute hydrochloric
acid:
NaNO2 + HCl → HNO2 + NaCl
nitric(III) acid
The first step in the synthesis of a dye is the production of benzenediazonium chloride:

Note that the positive charge on the diazonium ion (C6H5N2+) is on the nitrogen atom bonded to the
benzene ring, shown with four bonds in the equation above.
In the second step, the diazonium ion reacts with an alkaline solution of phenol in a coupling
reaction:

Figure 27.8: The azo dye (also called a diazonium dye) forms in a coupling reaction between the diazonium ion and
an alkaline solution of phenol.

Explaining the steps in making an azo dye
Step 1: The reaction between nitrous acid and phenylamine is called diazotisation.

The reaction mixture must be kept below 10 °C using ice. This is because the diazonium ion is unstable and
will decompose easily, giving off nitrogen gas, N2, at higher temperatures.
Step 2: In the coupling reaction, the positively charged diazonium ion acts as an electrophile. It substitutes
into the benzene ring of phenol at the 4 position, directly opposite the ─OH group.

The orange dye formed is called an azo dye, or diazonium dye.
Its delocalised π bonding system extends between the two benzene rings through the ─N═N─ azo group,
which acts like a bridge between the two rings. This makes the azo dye, called 4hydroxyphenylazobenzene, very stable (an important characteristic of a good dye). The azo dye forms
immediately on addition of the alkaline solution of phenol to the solution containing the diazonium ion
(Figure 27.8).
By using alternative aryl compounds to phenol, such as C6H5N(CH3)2, we can make a range of brightly
coloured dyes. For example, Figure 27.9 shows a molecule of a compound used as a yellow dye.

Figure 27.9: A molecule of a yellow azo dye. Instead of phenol, C6H5OH, the reactant used in the coupling reaction is
C6H5N(CH3)2.

Discuss with another learner how you both tackled Question 3.

27.3 Amino acids
Amino acids are an important group of compounds that all contain:
the basic amino group (─NH2), and
the acidic carboxylic acid group (─COOH).
This makes the amino acids amphoteric, as they can behave as both an acid and a base.
One type of amino acid has the ─NH2 group bonded to the carbon atom next to the ─COOH group. These 2aminocarboxylic acids are the ‘building blocks’ that make up proteins. There are about 20 of these
naturally occurring amino acids.
The general structure of an amino acid (2-aminocarboxylic acid) molecule is shown in Figure 27.10.

Figure 27.10: The general structure of an amino acid (a 2-aminocarboxylic acid).

The general structural formula of an amino acid (2-aminocarboxylic acid) is RCH(NH2)COOH.
The R group is the part of the amino acid that can vary in different amino acids. The simplest amino acid is
glycine (systematic name aminoethanoic acid) in which R is an H atom:

Alanine (systematic name 2-aminopropanoic acid) is an amino acid in which the R group is the methyl
group, ─CH3.
The R group can be:
acidic (e.g. it contains another carboxylic acid group, ─COOH group),
basic (e.g. it contains another amine group, ─NH2 group), or
neutral (e.g. when R is an alkyl group).

Reactions of amino acids
Amino acids will undergo most reactions of amines and carboxylic acids. However, each molecule can
interact within itself due to its basic ─NH2 group and its acidic ─COOH group:

The ion is called a zwitterion (from the German ‘zwei’ meaning ‘two’) as it carries two charges: one positive
(─NH3+) and one negative (─COO−). The ionic nature of the zwitterions gives amino acids relatively strong
intermolecular forces of attraction. They are crystalline solids that are soluble in water.
A solution of amino acids in water contains zwitterions that have both acidic and basic properties (i.e. they
are amphoteric). They will resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added to them.
Solutions that do this are called buffer solutions (see Section 21.4).

If the pH is lowered by adding acid, the ─COO− part of the zwitterion will accept an H+ ion, re-forming the
undissociated ─COOH group. This leaves a positively charged ion:

If the pH is raised by adding a base, the ─NH3+ part of the zwitterion will donate an H+ ion to the hydroxide
ion (H+ + OH− → H2O), re-forming the amine ─NH2 group. This leaves a negatively charged ion:

By adjusting the pH by small amounts, we can reach a point where neither the positive nor negative ions
shown above dominate, so the amino acid has no charge overall. This pH is called the isoelectric point of
an amino acid.
The isoelectric point can be found by measuring the pH value of the amino acid solution when it is not
attracted to either a positive electrode or a negative electrode (see ‘Electrophoresis’ in Section 27.6).

B

iii

Draw the structure of the ion of serine present in acidic conditions.

iv

Draw the structure of the ion of serine present in alkaline conditions.

v

Discuss with a partner what we mean by the isoelectric point of serine.

27.4 Peptides
Amino acid molecules can also react with each other. The acidic ─COOH group in one animo acid molecule
reacts with the basic ─NH2 group in another molecule. When two amino acids react together, the resulting
molecule is called a dipeptide.

Note that the shaded area is the amide bond between the two amino acids. An amide bond between two
amino acid molecules is also called a peptide bond or peptide link. The reaction is a condensation reaction,
as a small molecule, in this case water, is eliminated when the reactant molecules join together.
You can see that the dipeptide product still has an amine group, ─NH2, at one end and a carboxylic acid
group, ─COOH, at the other end. Therefore the reaction can continue, to form a tripeptide initially, and
then ever-longer chains of amino acids. The longer molecules are known as polypeptides, and then proteins
as they become even longer sequences of amino acids (see Chapter 28).

Question
5

The R groups in the amino acids alanine and valine are ─CH3 and (CH3)2HC─, respectively.
a

Draw the structures of both these amino acids.

b

Give an equation to show the formation of a dipeptide made from alanine and valine.

27.5 Reactions of the amides
The amide group is represented in structural formulae by ─CONH2. For example, ethanamide can be shown
as CH3CONH2.
Its displayed formula is:

Unlike the basic amines that you learned about at the start of this chapter, the amides are neutral
compounds. The presence of the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom in the amide group means that the
lone pair on the nitrogen atom of an amide is not available to donate to electron-deficient species, such as
H+ ions.

Preparing an amide
The acyl chlorides are more reactive compounds than the carboxylic acids they are made from (see Section
26.3) and they are used for synthesising other useful compounds, such as amides.
Ethanamide can be made by reacting ethanoyl chloride with concentrated ammonia solution:
CH3COCl + NH3 → CH3CONH2 + HCl
A primary amine, such as ethylamine, reacts with an acyl chloride to produce a substituted amide:
C3H7COCl + C2H5NH2 → C3H7CONHC2H5 + HCl
Both these reactions occur at room temperature, releasing white fumes of hydrogen chloride as soon as
the reactants are added together. If there is an excess of the amine, it will react with the HCl formed to
make its salt. For example, in the previous reaction ethylamine will form ethylammonium chloride,
C2H5NH3+Cl−.
The italic letter N is used in naming substituted amides to denote which alkyl (or aryl) group or groups are
bonded to the nitrogen atom. For example, in N-ethylbutanamide, C3H7CONHC2H5, the ethyl (C2H5─) group
has replaced an H atom in the amide group. If the H atom on the nitrogen in this molecule is replaced by
another alkyl or aryl group, two Ns are used in the name, e.g. C3H7CON(C2H5)2 is called N,Ndiethylbutanamide.

Hydrolysis of amides
The characteristic ─CONH─ group in substituted amides links the two hydrocarbon sections of their
molecules together. This amide link can be broken by hydrolysis with an acid or an alkali. The amide is
refluxed with, for example, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solution, to hydrolyse it:

The products of hydrolysis of a substituted amide with acid are a carboxylic acid (R1COOH) and a primary
amine (R2NH2). The amine formed will react with excess acid in the reaction vessel to make its ammonium

salt, e.g. R2NH3+Cl− with excess hydrochloric acid.
With an alkali, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, the products are the sodium salt of the carboxylic acid
(R1COO−Na+) and the primary amine (R2NH2).
If we reflux an unsubstituted amide (RCONH2) with acid, the products are the corresponding carboxylic acid
and ammonia. The ammonia in solution reacts with excess acid to make an ammonium salt. With an alkali,
the products are the salt of the carboxylic acid and ammonia.

27.6 Electrophoresis
How electrophoresis works
Electrophoresis is used extensively in biochemical analysis. It can be used to separate, identify and purify
proteins. We can use it with the amino acids and peptides obtained when a protein is hydrolysed.
The analytical technique of electrophoresis is based on separating ions placed in an electric field.

IMPORTANT
If a sample is placed between two oppositely charged electrodes:
positively charged ions will move towards the negatively charged electrode
negatively charged ions will move towards the positively charged electrode.

The sample is placed on absorbent paper or a gel supported on a glass plate. A buffer solution carries the
ions along.
The rate at which the ions move towards the oppositely charged electrode depends, among other things,
on the size and charge on the ions. Larger ions will move more slowly; highly charged ions will move more
quickly.
Therefore the ions are separated as the electric field is applied. You get a series of lines or bands on the
paper or gel once a locating agent is applied. Sometimes ultraviolet light is used to show the bands up. The
series of bands is called an electropherogram (Figure 27.11).

Figure 27.11: Comparing electropherograms.

Let us consider a simple example of how a mixture of three amino acids undergoes separation. Amino acid
A could have a side-chain that is positively charged in a certain buffer solution, amino acid B could be
neutral and amino acid C could be negatively charged (Figure 27.12).

Figure 27.12: The principle of gel electrophoresis.

At a pH of 7, the amino acid species present in samples of A, B and C are shown in Figure 27.13.
The chemical structures in Figure 27.13 show why we need to control the pH with a buffer solution in
electrophoresis. In Section 27.3, we saw how amino acids react in acidic and alkaline conditions to form
ions. The charge on the ions depends on the pH. Therefore pH will affect the movement of ions during
electrophoresis.
When separating a mixture of proteins, they are usually first treated with a chemical that makes them all
negatively charged. A dye can also be added. All the proteins then migrate in the same direction towards
the positive electrode, but larger proteins move more slowly.

Figure 27.13: The charge on amino acids depends on the pH of the solution.

Question

A mixture of three amino acids is separated by gel electrophoresis.

SUMMARY
Primary amines contain the ─NH2 group.
Ethylamine is prepared either by reducing ethanenitrile, e.g. with hydrogen gas using a nickel catalyst, or by
treating bromoethane with an excess of hot, ethanolic ammonia.
Phenylamine is prepared by reducing nitrobenzene using tin and concentrated hydrochloric acid, then adding NaOH
(aq).
Like ammonia, amines behave as bases. Because of the lone pair of electrons on their nitrogen atom, they can
readily accept protons (H+ ions), reacting to form salts.
Ethylamine is a stronger base than ammonia because of the electron-releasing ethyl group.
Phenylamine is a weaker base than ammonia because the lone pair on the N atom of phenylamine is delocalised
into the benzene ring.
Phenylamine reacts with nitric(III) acid (nitrous acid) below 10 °C, to form benzenediazonium chloride and water;
this reaction is called diazotisation.
Diazonium salts react with other aryl compounds (such as phenol) to form dyes; this is known as a coupling
reaction. Diazonium dyes are commercially important.
The stability of diazonium dyes arises from the extensively delocalised π bonding electron system that covers their
benzene rings and the azo bridge ─N═N─ between them.
Amino acids (2-aminocarboxylic acids) have the general formula RCH(NH2)COOH, where R may be H, CH3 or another
organic group.
The amino group of an amino acid interacts with the acid group to form a zwitterion.
Amino acids react with both acids and bases to form salts.
The isoelectric point of an amino acid is the pH value at which there is no overall charge on that amino acid in its
aqueous solution.
Two amino acids react together in a condensation reaction, bonding together by an amide (peptide) bond to form a
dipeptide and water. Three amino acids form a tripeptide, and repetition of this condensation reaction many times
leads to the formation of polypeptides and proteins.
Amides are prepared by reacting acyl chlorides with ammonia or amines.
Amides can be hydrolysed by aqueous alkali or acid. With aqueous alkali the products are the salt of a carboxylic
acid and a primary amine. With acid hydrolysis the products are a carboxylic acid and a primary amine.
Electrophoresis uses an electric field to separate ions in a mixture. It is used widely in analysing the sequence of
amino acids in proteins.

where n is a very large number.

4

Here is a section of an addition polymer:

Draw the displayed formula of its monomer.

CONDUCTING POLYMERS
Most polymers are electrical insulators, which makes them very useful for making the casings of plugs,
sockets and light switches. However, a group of polymers have been developed that can conduct
electricity. One of the first was the poly(alkyne) polymer formed from the hydrocarbon called ethyne
(also still known by its old name, acetylene). The molecular formula of this monomer is C2H2 and its
displayed formula is:
H─C≡C─H
We can represent the formation of poly(ethyne) from its ethyne monomers as shown in Figure 28.1.

Figure 28.1: The polymerisation of ethyne (acetylene) to form a conducting polymer.

As drawn in Figure 28.1, the poly(ethyne) is in the trans-configuration rather than the cis-form of the
polymer. Figure 28.2 below shows how to represent the skeletal formulae of both forms. A polymer
chain with a mixture of cis- and trans-sections can be made by varying the reaction conditions.
In Figure 28.1 you can see the alternate double and single carbon–carbon bonds in poly(ethyne). This
can conduct electricity because its π bonding spreads continuously down the whole length of each
polymer chain. The overlapping p orbitals on neighbouring carbon atoms result in long bands of
delocalised electrons, above and below the plane of the atoms. These delocalised electrons are free to
move along the length of the polymer chains (see Sections 5.4 and 25.1).
Lots of research has been carried out to produce other conducting polymers with extended π bonding

systems. Poly(ethyne) and some other examples are shown by their skeletal formulae in Figure 28.2.
Conducting polymers usually have other substances, such as iodine, added to improve their electrical
conductivity. This is called doping. They have a number of advantages over the metal conductors that
they can potentially replace. They do not corrode, are much less dense, and can be shaped more
easily. For example, they can be made into thin sheets to make flat panels that light up. They can also
now be used in LED lighting. They are also ideal in situations where saving weight is important.

Figure 28.2: Some examples of conducting polymers: note the alternate double and single carbon–carbon bonds.

Questions for discussion
Working with another learner or group of learners:
Suggest how poly(ethyne) can conduct electricity, using your knowledge of π bonding.
Sketch a diagram to show how you visualise the extended π bonding system in poly(ethyne).
Suggest some uses of poly(ethyne) where saving weight is important.

28.1 Condensation polymerisation
In Chapter 27 we saw how amino acids can react together to form peptides. The reaction is called a
condensation reaction. We can think of it as an addition reaction (in which reactant molecules bond to each
other), followed by an elimination reaction (in which a small molecule is released).
For example, the following equation shows how three amino acid molecules can react to make a tripeptide:

A large protein molecule, formed by condensation polymerisation, can contain thousands of amino acid
monomers. As each amino acid monomer joins the chain, an amide bond (or peptide bond) forms, and an
H2O molecule is also produced (see Section 27.4).
We can recognise condensation polymerisation by its monomers that contain two different functional
groups capable of reacting with each other. This can occur in two ways:
the two different functional groups are found within the same molecule, as in amino acids. Each amino
acid monomer molecule has a basic ─NH2 functional group and an acidic ─COOH functional group
the two different functional groups are found in two different molecules. For example, nylon 6,6 is
made from two different monomers: one monomer has two ─NH2 functional groups, and the other
monomer has two ─COOH functional groups.
Condensation polymerisation also leads to the formation of small molecules, such as H2O or HCl.

REFLECTION
At the start of this chapter so far, what have you found difficult? What did you find easy to do?
Reflect on any areas you would like to improve. Are you unsure about any of the work you have
studied on addition and condensation polymerisation? If so, read through the work again, and look
back to the polymer work in Chapters 15 and 27 then ask for help if anything is still not clear.

28.2 Synthetic polyamides
Nylons
Chemists have used condensation polymerisation to make synthetic polyamides since the 1930s. Nylon is
a polyamide. Nylon can be made from a variety of monomers, but all nylons are made in reactions between
the amine group (─NH2) and a carboxylic acid (─COOH) or the more reactive acyl chloride group (─COCl).

For example, 1,6-diaminohexane reacts with hexanedioic acid to make nylon 6,6:

Figure 28.3: Climbers rely on nylon’s elasticity and high tensile strength to minimise the effects of a fall.

The numbers used in nylon 6,6 refer to the number of carbon atoms in each monomer unit.
Hexanedioyl dichloride, ClOC(CH2)4COCl, can be used as a more reactive, but more expensive, monomer
than hexanedioic acid.
Nylon’s low density, its strength and its elasticity make it a very useful fibre in the clothing industry. These
properties also make it ideal for climbing ropes (Figure 28.3).
During the manufacturing process, the nylon is forced out of nozzles and pulled into long fibres. This is
called cold drawing. It lines up the nylon polymer chains along the length of the fibre. Strong hydrogen
bonds form between neighbouring chains, accounting for nylon’s high tensile strength and elasticity.

Kevlar®

Kevlar is a polyamide containing benzene rings. It is very strong, but flexible. It is also resistant to fire and
abrasion. It has these properties because of its structure.
The monomers that make Kevlar are an aryl diamine and an aryl dicarboxylic acid or dioyl chloride (Figure
28.4).

Figure 28.4: The monomers, 1,4-diaminobenzene and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid, or benzene-1,4-dioyl chloride, that
react together to make the polymer Kevlar®.

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 28.1
Making nylon
Place a shallow layer of aqueous 1,6-diaminohexane in a very small beaker. Carefully add a solution of
decanedioyl dichloride which will float on top of the aqueous layer of the diamine. Using a pair of
tweezers slowly draw out a long, thin thread of nylon 6,10 from the boundary between the two
immiscible layers where the nylon polymer is forming.
The formula and structure of Kevlar are shown in Figure 28.5. The long, linear polymer chains of Kevlar can
line up next to each other in a regular pattern. This results in extensive hydrogen bonding between the
polymer chains of Kevlar.

Figure 28.5: a The formula showing the repeat unit of Kevlar. b The hydrogen bonding between chains of the polyamide
(shown by three red dots). The latest tennis rackets contain Kevlar, where its low density and strength are important. The
wings of fighter jets can also be made of Kevlar.

The exceptional properties of Kevlar have also led to its use in making bullet-proof vests, ropes, fireprotective clothing (as used by Formula 1 racing drivers) and modern ‘leathers’ worn by motorcycle riders.
The polymer is also used to reinforce other materials, such as the rubber in tyres.
Instead of using diamino and dicarboxylic acid monomers, it is also possible to make synthetic polymers
from monomers that contain both amino and carboxylic acid groups with the same monomer. These
monomers will react together in a similar way to the condensation polymerisation seen in nylons and
Kevlar to form polyamides.

Question

easy’ or ‘Questions that I struggled to answer’ columns.
Compare your table with others in the group; help each other with any issues, and identify any
problems that you need further support with.

28.3 Biochemical polyamides
Proteins are made from amino acids
Proteins have their monomers bonded to each other via amide bonds (or peptide bonds). This means that
polypeptides and proteins are types of polyamide.
The amino acids found in proteins are called α-amino acids (Figure 28.6). The names of the amino acids
found in proteins can be written in a shorthand form containing three letters. For example, Ala is alanine,
Try is tryptophan and Gln is glutamine.

serine (Ser)

aspartic acid (Asp)

lysine (Lys)

Table 28.1: Examples of the three different classes of side-chains (in red) in the amino acids found in proteins.

The 20 different amino acids that cells use to build proteins are distinguished by their side-chains (R
groups). The side-chains can be classified as non-polar, polar or electrically charged (acidic or basic). Table
28.1 shows some examples.

Proteins are condensation polymers
In Section 27.3 you learned that the ─NH2 group of one amino acid can react with the ─COOH of another
amino acid to form a dipeptide by a condensation reaction. The links between individual units of the
polymer are called amide bonds (or peptide bonds). Additional amino acids can then react to form a

tripeptide, a tetrapeptide, and so on. Eventually a polypeptide, containing many peptide bonds, is formed.
A polypeptide chain may contain 50 to 2000 amino acids. An amino acid unit within a polypeptide chain is
called an amino acid residue. We draw the amino acid sequence in a polypeptide starting from the end
that has a free ─NH2 group (the N-terminal end).

Proteins may contain one or more polypeptide chains. Each protein has its own, unique function because
each protein has its own, unique 3D shape.
The primary structure of a polypeptide or protein is the order in which the amino acids are linked together.
The primary structure of one of the polypeptide chains of insulin is shown in Figure 28.7.

Figure 28.7: The primary sequence of the insulin A chain, a short polypeptide of 21 amino acids. Notice the ─S─S─ link
(disulfide bridge) between two amino acid residues. This helps maintain the shape of the polypeptide.

The structure of a protein:
is written with the amino acids numbered from the N-terminal end
determines the way that the protein can fold to form its unique shape
is held together by covalent bonds. These bonds are found within amino acid residues, and between
the residues as amide (or peptide) bonds.

Question

a

Name and give the formulae of the two functional groups present in all amino acids.

b

Name an example of an amino acid with a non-polar side-chain.

c

amino acid monomers together in a polypeptide or a protein?

e

A

─CONH─

B

─CONH2─

C

─COONH─

D

─COONH2─

State what is meant by the term amino acid residue.

Polyesters
Polyesters are another type of condensation polymer. As you learned in Chapter 17, esters are made by
reacting carboxylic acids with alcohols:
carboxylic acid + alcohol → ester + water

Therefore, polyesters can be made by reacting dicarboxylic acids with diols, e.g. propanedioic acid and
ethane-1,2-diol. The most common polyester fibre is Terylene®.
Terylene is made from benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid and ethane-1,2-diol. The conditions required are a
catalyst such as antimony(III) oxide and heat:

Poly(lactic acid), PLA, is another polyester. However, PLA is made using just one monomer, lactic acid. Its
systematic name is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The monomer contains the carboxylic acid and alcohol
(hydroxyl) groups within each molecule:

The ester group bonding each repeat unit together in the chain is shown in a structural formula as ─COO─.

Question
Work as a pair on this question:

a

Draw the repeat unit of the polyester, PLA (shown above).

b

Draw the repeat unit of Terylene.

REFLECTION
Reflect on the process you went through to determine the repeat unit. Are you confident you can go
through the same process for other polymers?

28.4 Degradable polymers
The disposal of polymer waste, much of it made up of poly(alkene)s, is an ever-increasing problem
worldwide. Poly(alkene)s, such as poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are chemically inert because their
polymer chains are non-polar, saturated hydrocarbons, like giant alkane molecules. This makes them nonbiodegradable.
However, chemists have developed degradable polymers that do break down when they are discarded. The
use of degradable polymers is becoming more common as people become aware of the issues related to
the disposal of poly(alkene)s as a result of their lack of reactivity (see Section 15.5, ‘Disposal of
poly(alkene) plastics’).
Two of the developments to help solve the disposal problem are biodegradable polymers and
photodegradable polymers (Figure 28.8).

Figure 28.8: Chemists are developing plastics that can be broken down by microorganisms in soil or by light.

Biodegradable polymers
Some polymers, when buried for many years, eventually become brittle and break down into smaller
pieces that can be decomposed naturally by microorganisms in soil. If the surface area of the polymer
being buried could be increased, then it could degrade much more quickly. Scientists have developed
polymers that contain small amounts of starch granules that the bacteria and fungi in moist soil can break
down. So the polymer is broken into smaller pieces, with a larger surface area for decomposition to occur
faster. Other polymers are now made from monomers derived directly from plant materials, such as PLA,
which soil microorganisms can digest easily.
In polyamides, such as nylon, the amide bonds, ─CO─NH─, between the repeat units can be broken down
over time. This occurs by hydrolysis in the hot, acidic conditions found in land-fill waste dumps with rotting
vegetation.

You can see the hydrolysis reaction of an amide in Section 27.5, in which carboxylic acids and amines are
formed. In hot, acidic conditions the products of hydrolysis of a polyamide are its original diamine and
dicarboxylic acid monomers or the original aminocarboxylic acid monomer. The amine (─NH2) groups will
react with any excess acid to make their ammonium salts.
With an excess of alkali, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, the sodium salts of the original dicarboxylic
acid monomers (plus the diamine monomers) will form. If the polyamide was made from an
aminocarboxylic acid, then the sodium salt of the amino acid will form, for example, H2N─R─COO−Na+.
In polyesters, the ester links (─COO─) are similarly broken down by acid hydrolysis, forming alcohols and
carboxylic acids (see Section 17.3).

The polyester PLA, whose raw material is starch from crops such as corn, is now being used as a
biodegradable alternative to oil-based polymers. The ester links can be hydrolysed in acidic conditions to
break down the polymer chains when used items containing polyesters are dumped in land-fill sites.
Alcohol and carboxylic acids will be the products of the acid hydrolysis of polyesters.

IMPORTANT
Because they will undergo hydrolysis, this makes both polyamides and polyesters biodegradable,
unlike the nonbiodegradable polyalkenes.

Photodegradable polymers
Polymer chains also have been designed that incorporate carbonyl groups (>C═O) at intervals down their
length. These carbonyl groups absorb energy from the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
This causes the bonds in the region of the carbonyl group to weaken and break down. As the polymer
breaks into smaller fragments, the polymer will biodegrade much more quickly if it is not chemically inert.
Polyamides and polyesters both contain carbonyl groups.
There is some debate as to whether photodegradable polymers are better for the environment or not. In a
landfill site, the polymer waste is often buried under other rubbish and eventually soil, so there is no light
available to trigger the breakdown of the polymer chains. They also make recycling polymers problematic,
as they could weaken a recycled mixture of different polymers when it is put to a new use.

28.5 Polymer deductions
You may encounter a variety of different problems about polymers to solve, such as:
1 predict the type of polymerisation reaction for a given monomer or pair of monomers
2 deduce the repeat unit of a polymer obtained from a given monomer or pair of monomers
3 deduce the type of polymerisation reaction that produces a given section of a polymer molecule
4 identify the monomer(s) from a given section of a polymer molecule.

Predicting the type of polymerisation reaction for given
monomer(s)
Addition polymers
Given a monomer that contains the C═C double bond, it will undergo addition polymerisation. Many
addition polymers are made using one type of monomer, e.g. poly(propene) from propene monomers.
(However, co-polymers can also be produced by using more than one type of unsaturated monomer, e.g.
with H2C═CH2 and H2C═CHCOOH in the reaction mixture). See Section 15.5 to remind yourself about
tackling questions on addition polymers.

Condensation polymers
When identifying monomers used in condensation polymerisation, look out for the presence of two
functional groups that will react with each other, giving off a small molecule in the reaction. These two
functional groups can be in the same molecule, as in the case of poly(lactic acid) in Section 28.3, or at
either end of two different monomers, as in nylon 6,6 in Section 28.3. The functional groups involved in
condensation polymerisation are usually:
amines (─NH2) and carboxylic acids (─COOH) producing a polyamide and H2O
amines (─NH2) and acyl chlorides (─COCl) producing a polyamide and HCl
carboxylic acids (─COOH) and alcohols (─OH) producing a polyester and H2O
acyl chlorides (─COCl) and alcohols (─OH) producing a polyester and HCl.

Deducing the repeat unit of a polymer for given monomer(s)
Addition polymers
If you are given a monomer with a C═C double bond, simply turn the double bond into a C─C single bond
and show the bonds either side of the two C atoms that would continue the chain:

Condensation polymers
If you are given monomers with two reactive functional groups, draw the product formed when two
monomers react together. Then take off the atoms at both ends that would be lost if another two
monomers were to react with those groups:

Deducing the type of polymerisation reaction for a given
section of a polymer chain
Addition polymers
Polymers resulting from addition polymerisation will have repeat units with no functional groups in the
actual chain of carbon atoms that forms the ‘backbone’ of the polymer. Poly(phenylethene) is an example:

Note that functional groups may be present on the side-chains, such as the nitrile group, ─CN. However,
the ‘backbone’ in addition polymers usually consists of a chain of carbon atoms.

Condensation polymers
Polymers resulting from condensation polymerisation will have amide links (─CONH─) or ester links
(─COO─) in the ‘backbone’ of the polymer chain. For example:

Identifying the monomer(s) present in a given section of a
polymer chain
This is an extension of the approach above. Having decided whether the polymer was made in an addition
or a condensation polymerisation, you can then split the polymer chain into its repeat units.

Addition polymers
With an addition polymer, you need to put the C═C double bond back into the monomer:

Condensation polymers
With condensation polymers, you need to identify the atoms from the small molecules given off in the
polymerisation reaction and replace them on the reactive functional groups in the monomers.

unsure.

SUMMARY
Polymers are very large molecules that are built up from a very large number of small molecules known as
monomers.
Remember from Chapter 15 that addition polymerisation occurs when an unsaturated monomer, such as an alkene,
bonds to itself in an addition reaction. Poly(ethene), poly(propene), poly(chloroethene) and poly(phenylethene) are
all common addition polymers.
Condensation polymerisation involves the loss of a small molecule (usually water or hydrogen chloride) in the
reaction between two monomer molecules. Both polyesters and polyamides are formed by condensation
polymerisation.
Polyamides are formed by condensation polymerisation between an amine group and a carboxylic acid group. These
groups may be in the same monomer or on different monomers. Nylon 6,6 is formed in a condensation
polymerisation between 1,6-diaminohexane and hexanedioic acid.
Condensation polymerisation between the amino and carboxylic acid groups in amino acids produces a polypeptide
or protein. The links between the repeat units in these polymers are called amide bonds, also known as peptide
bonds.
The polyester called Terylene is formed by condensation polymerisation of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid with
ethane-1,2-diol. H2O is the small molecule eliminated in the reaction.
The amino acids molecules that react to form proteins contain a carboxylic acid, an amino group and a side-chain
(represented by R) all attached to the same carbon atom. They have the general formula NH2CH(R)COOH.
Proteins and polypeptides can be hydrolysed by refluxing in a strong acid, such as HCl(aq), forming amino acids (2aminocarboxylic acids).
Polyesters and polyamides are biodegradable by acidic or alkaline hydrolysis and by the action of light, breaking
their ester or amide links between their monomers in the polymer chains.

LEARNING INTENTIONS
In this chapter you will learn how to:
explain the meaning of:
enantiomers
chiral centres
polarised light
optically active mixtures and racemic mixtures
state reasons why the synthetic preparation of drug molecules often requires the production of a single optical
isomer, e.g. better therapeutic activity, fewer side-effects
for an organic molecule containing several functional groups:
identify organic functional groups using key reactions
predict properties and reactions
devise multi-stage synthetic routes for preparing organic molecules using key reactions

analyse a given synthetic route in terms of type of reaction and reagents used for each step of it, and possible byproducts.

Look back to Chapter 14 if you are having trouble with the tasks above.

DESIGNING A DRUG

Figure 29.1: Chemists around the world work in large teams to model, develop and test new medicinal drugs.

How do we go about designing new molecules to fight diseases? One way is to identify the structural
features the new drug will need to stop particular bacteria or viruses working (Figure 29.1). The
structural features may be associated with the active site on a particular enzyme needed for an
essential function of the pathogen (the disease-causing organism). Once these structural features
have been identified, we can then predict the shape of a molecule that would fit into, and then block,
the active site.
The functional groups present are also very important to ensure the drug can bind into the active site
effectively. The intermolecular bonds formed between the drug and its target molecule could involve
hydrogen bonding, ionic attraction, dipole–dipole forces, and instantaneous dipole–induced dipole
forces (see Chapter 4).
Computers are now used to judge the fit between a potential drug molecule and a receptor site on its
target molecule. Such ‘molecular modelling’ has greatly speeded up the process of designing new
medicines. The interactions and fit of a potential medicine with a biological receptor molecule can be
studied before the medicine is ever made in the lab. Before molecular modelling became available, the
synthesis of a new medicine involved far more trial and error, with chemists having to prepare many
more possible medicines for testing.
This type of research was used in the fight against AIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s. Scientists using
X-ray crystallography (a method in which a sample is irradiated with X-rays and the pattern is analysed
by computer) worked out the shape of HIV protease in 1988 (Figure 29.2). Knowing its structure made

the search for drugs to fight AIDS much quicker and cheaper than traditional trial-and-error methods.

Figure 29.2: A ‘ribbon diagram’ showing the symmetrical HIV protease molecule, with its active site in the centre of
the molecule.

This enzyme plays an important role when the virus becomes infectious. Researchers realised that if a
molecule could be discovered that could block its active site, this might be one step on the route to
finding a cure for AIDS. Knowing the molecule that the enzyme worked on (its substrate), researchers
were able to construct similar molecules on the computer screen to fit the active site.
In less than eight years, pharmaceutical companies had developed three new anti-viral drugs for
people with HIV / AIDS and the death rate from AIDS dropped significantly. These inhibitors are now
one part of a cocktail of drugs that can be used to treat the disease.

Question for discussion
Discuss with another learner or group of learners how molecular modelling has helped in the search for
new and improved medicinal drugs. Think about:
the method used to determine the structure of HIV protease
how anti-viral drugs work
the time and costs involved.

29.1 Chirality in pharmaceutical synthesis
The pharmaceutical industry is constantly searching for new drugs. Research chemists have discovered
that most of these drugs contain at least one chiral centre (see Section 14.6). Remember that a molecule
containing a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups of atoms can exist as two nonsuperimposable mirror images. The carbon atom is called a chiral centre. These two mirror-image isomers
are called enantiomers and they will be optically active. They differ only in their ability to rotate the plane
of polarised light to the left or to the right, and in their potential biological activity (and hence their
effectiveness as medicines).
Using conventional organic reactions to make the desired product will yield a 50 : 50 mixture of the two
enantiomers. We call this a racemic mixture. Although the physical and chemical properties of the
enantiomers will be identical, each differs in its biological (or pharmaceutical) activity, i.e. the effect the
drug has on the body. For example, naproxen is a drug used to treat the pain caused by arthritis (see Figure
29.3). One of its enantiomers will ease the pain but the other can cause liver damage.
As another example of the need to separate the enantiomers from a racemic mixture, one enantiomer of a
drug used to treat tuberculosis (TB) is effective, whereas the other can cause blindness.

IMPORTANT
Chemists ideally need a single pure enantiomer to put in their drug product.
Note that about 80% of new drugs patented are single enantiomers.
Using pure enantiomers will be beneficial as it:
reduces the patient’s dosage by half as the pure enantiomer is more potent, i.e. has better therapeutic
activity (thereby cutting the cost of production)
minimises the risk of side-effects (thereby protecting patients from further problems and protecting
drug companies from possible legal action for damages if serious side-effects do occur).
At this point, you can also refer to the ‘Fighting cancer’ section at the start of Chapter 24, which looks at
the drug cis-platin.

29.2 Preparing pure enantiomers for use as drugs
Optical resolution
This method involves chemists following a traditional synthetic route to make the compound, resulting in a
racemic (50 : 50) mixture. Then they separate the two enantiomers in a process called optical resolution.
This involves using a pure enantiomer of another optically active compound (called a chiral auxiliary) that
will react with one of the isomers in the mixture. The new product formed will now have different properties
and so can be separated by physical means. For example, their solubility in a given solvent will differ so the
unwanted enantiomer and the new product can be separated by fractional crystallisation. The new product
is then converted back to the desired enantiomer in a simple reaction (e.g. by adding dilute alkali).
The crystallisation is repeated many times to ensure purity. This method is difficult, time-consuming, uses
extra reagents and involves the disposal of half the original racemic mixture.
Large volumes of organic solvents (often harmful to the environment) are used in the process. However,
chemists are now using supercritical carbon dioxide as a solvent, which is much safer. At 31 °C and 73
atmospheres pressure, CO2 is a suitable non-polar solvent for many drug derivatives in the racemic
resolution process. The solubility of the derivatives can be changed simply by varying the density of the
solvent. The solvent, which is non-toxic, is easily removed by reducing the pressure and then recycling it to
use in the process again.
We can also use high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate a racemic mixture, as long as
the stationary medium (i.e. the solid that packs the column) is itself optically active.

Using optically active starting materials
This technique uses starting materials that are themselves optically active and in the same orientation as
the desired product. These are often naturally occurring compounds such as carbohydrates or L-amino
acids. The biochemist will choose from this ‘chiral pool’. The synthetic route is designed to keep any
intermediates and the final product formed in the same enantiomeric form. As a result, there is no need to
carry out the costly separation process needed when a racemic mixture is produced.

Chiral catalysts
If possible, the most efficient way to prepare a pure enantiomer is to use a chiral catalyst.
Chemists are also developing new chiral catalysts that ensure only one specific enantiomer is formed in a
reaction. The benefits of these catalysts are that only small quantities are needed and they can be used
over and over again, although the catalyst itself can be expensive. A ruthenium (Ru) organometallic
catalyst is used in the production of naproxen, a drug to treat arthritis (see Figure 29.3).
Often scientists need a combination of optical resolution and chiral synthesis in the production of a
pharmaceutically active, pure enantiomer.
The pharmaceutical industry can also use enzymes to promote stereoselectivity and produce singleenantiomer products. The specific shape and the nature of the molecular interactions at the active site of
an enzyme (a biological catalyst) ensure that only one enantiomer will be formed, as in living things. The
enzymes are often immobilised (fixed in place) on inert supports. This enables the reactants to be passed
over them without the need to separate the product from the enzymes after the reaction.
However, it can be expensive isolating enzymes from living things. Using whole organisms, such as
bacteria, can reduce this cost. In recent times, synthetic enzymes designed for a particular synthesis have
also been made. Therefore, a search for a suitable enzyme from the limited pool available from natural
sources is not always necessary.
Overall, using an enzyme process might take longer to develop than a conventional synthetic route, but in
the long run the benefits generally outweigh the disadvantages. There are fewer steps needed in the
synthesis route, resulting in a ‘greener’ process.

Figure 29.3: The chiral catalyst (an organometallic ruthenium compound) ensures only the desired enantiomer is formed:
in this case, the naproxen enantiomer that is effective in treating arthritis. The chiral centre in naproxen is marked with an
asterisk. The marked carbon atom is also known as an ‘asymmetric carbon’.

Question
Discuss these questions in a small group before writing your answers.
1

a

Why are pure enantiomers rather than racemic mixtures the better option for use as
pharmaceutical drugs from the point of view of:
i

a patient

ii

a pharmaceutical company?

b

Why are modern chiral catalyst-based processes, or using enzymes, for manufacturing pure
enantiomers more sustainable (environmentally friendly) than traditional synthetic routes used by
the pharmaceutical industry?

c

Find out why the drug thalidomide resulted in legal action against its manufacturer.

29.3 Synthetic routes
When research chemists want to make a new compound, they usually work backwards from the desired
compound to create a series of reactions, starting with a compound extracted from a commonly available
raw material. In industry, common starting materials are hydrocarbons from crude oil and its refining, and
compounds extracted from plants, such as esters from vegetable oils.

REFLECTION
1

Reflect on how a molecule containing two chiral centres could have no effect on plane-polarised
light. Discuss your reasoning with a partner.

2

Discuss with a partner your ideas about why pairs of enantiomers differ in their effectiveness as
drugs. Think about the role of active sites in how enzymes work.

3

Are you satisfied that you understand the terms and issues regarding the use of enantiomers in
medicinal drugs? If not, it is a good idea to revise the basics of stereoisomerism in Chapter 14, and
read through the start of this chapter again, making notes about any points you need support
with.

4

What other learning strategies will you use when looking back at Chapter 14?

You will need some of the skills of a research chemist when tackling questions that involve:
predicting the reactions of complex molecules you have never seen before, containing more than one
functional group
suggesting a series of reactions to make a given compound from a given starting compound.
In order to be successful in answering these questions, you will need to be familiar with all the reactions
and conditions of each homologous series mentioned in the syllabus.
The flow chart in Figure 29.4 is a summary of some of the most useful reactions you need to know.
However, you could be asked about others, so it is a good idea to make your own summary spider charts
for all the reactions in Chapters 15 to 18, and 25 to 28.

Figure 29.4: Some of the important organic reactions you need to remember for both the AS and A Level courses.

For example, for Chapter 16 write the word ‘Halogenoalkane’ in a box and draw arrows radiating out from
the box to the products made in their reactions, labelling the arrows with other reactants and the reaction
conditions. Displaying these on a wall and using different colours will help you remember them.
Suppose we want to convert ethene to ethanoic acid. A possible route is to convert ethene to ethanol,
which is then oxidised to ethanoic acid. Alternatively, ethene could be converted to bromoethane, which is

then hydrolysed to ethanol, and this is oxidised to ethanoic acid. This second alternative involves an extra
reaction step. You should usually try to complete a synthesis in as few steps as possible. Remember that
material is lost at each stage when preparing organic compounds. Reaction yields seldom approach 100%.
You also need to recall the reactions of benzene and its related compounds. Figure 29.5 provides you with a
summary of reactions involving aromatic compounds. You can try copying and displaying the reaction
summaries (from Figures 29.4 and 29.5) where you will look at them regularly: this will help you to learn
the reactions and their conditions.

Figure 29.5: Summary of reactions involving aromatic (aryl) compounds needed for the A Level course.

Question
2

Show a sequence of reactions to plan how the following conversions can be made in two- or three-step
syntheses.
Include the conditions required for each reaction.
(Start by drawing the structural formulae of the initial and final compounds).
a

ethene to ethylamine.

b

benzaldehyde to ethyl benzoate.

c

1-bromobutane to butanoic acid.

d

butan-2-one to 2-aminobutane.

REFLECTION
Join another learner to reflect on how well you tackled these four problems. Discuss the thought
processes you used when solving each problem.
Which problem did you find easiest and which was most difficult? Think about why some problems are
easier than others and what you need to do to successfully design synthetic routes.

Adding carbon atoms
Sometimes the starting compound from a raw material does not have enough carbon atoms in its

molecules to make the desired product. An extra carbon atom can be added by adding the nitrile functional
group, ─C≡N. Remember that these can be made from halogenoalkanes:

where R is an alkyl group, so RC≡N has an extra carbon atom.
The RC≡N molecule can be either hydrolysed to make a carboxylic acid (by refluxing with dilute
hydrochloric acid) or reduced to make an amine (by adding LiAlH4 in dry ether).
We can add an alkyl or acyl side-chain to a benzene ring by carrying out a Friedel–Crafts reaction, which is
another useful reaction when planning synthetic routes.
For example:

A

C6H4H+N≡N

B

C6H5N≡N+

C

C6H5N+═N

D

C6H5N+≡N

REFLECTION
Reflect on the chemistry of aryl compounds with a partner. Do you find their reactions more difficult to
understand and remember than other organic reactions?
Discuss with a partner any ways you have found useful to help recall organic reactions and the
conditions they need. Share your ideas with another pair.

SUMMARY
Both natural biochemical compounds and modern medicinal drugs contain chiral molecules. Generally, only one of
the enantiomers of a drug is beneficial to living organisms and the other isomer may have undesirable effects. The
beneficial isomer has the appropriate shape and pattern of intermolecular forces to interact with a receptor
molecule in a living organism.
Chemists are now producing drugs containing single enantiomers rather than a racemic mixture of isomers. This
enables the dose to be halved, improves biological / pharmacological activity (behaviour of molecule in an
organism), reduces side-effects, and minimises litigation against manufacturers.
Recognising the functional groups in a given organic molecule enables us to predict its reactions.
Knowing the reactions of the different functional groups in organic reactions enables us to devise synthetic routes to
make given compounds.

BEFORE YOU START
The analytical techniques introduced in this chapter are used together with mass spectrometry
(Chapter 3) and infrared spectroscopy (Chapter 18).
Working in a group of five, choose one of the following topics to teach the rest of the group how to use
a mass spectrum to deduce:

USING NMR
NMR spectroscopy (see Section 30.4) is an analytical tool used extensively to find out the structures of
biological macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. As well as identifying the different
types of 1H atoms present, more sophisticated data can give, for example, the distance between
atoms in macromolecules. Large amounts of data are collected and analysed by computer programs to
reveal the shape of the molecules under investigation.
Figures 30.1, 30.2 and 30.3 show images obtained from NMR analysis of protein molecules made up
from over 100 amino acid residues (see Section 28.3). These images are called ribbon diagrams.

Figure 30.1: A protein made up of 106 amino acid residues.

This type of NMR analysis takes place in solution, so it is particularly useful for medical research. Many
human proteins exist in solution in the body so we can mimic the interactions that take place in cells
or in the bloodstream.

Figure 30.2: A protein made up of 153 amino acid residues.

Ribbon diagrams were developed in the 1980s, with Jane Richardson’s hand-drawn images published
in the Journal Advances in Protein Chemistry (Figure 30.4).

At present, these useful images are computer generated, sometimes with areas of the protein shown
using the ball-and-stick model to add extra detail.

Figure 30.4: Jane Richardson is known as ‘The mother of the ribbon diagrams’. She was born in 1941 and heads a
research group at Duke University in America, where she has worked since 1970. Ribbon diagrams are also referred to
as ‘Richardson diagrams’.

30.1 General principles of chromatography
The basics of chromatography
You will be familiar with the technique of paper chromatography. It is used to separate mixtures as a
solvent moves up a piece of absorbent paper.
We call the solvent the mobile phase, and water trapped between the cellulose fibres of the paper is the
stationary phase. The substances in the mixture will have different affinities for the solvent and for the
water, and so they move at different rates over the paper. Look at Figure 30.5.

Figure 30.5: a Paper chromatography. b The chromatogram produced. Components of the mixture can be identified by
comparison with pure reference compounds or by calculating Rf values (see Figure 30.6) and comparing these values with
those in tables of data.

The Rf values (retardation factors) of substances are calculated as shown in Figure 30.6. The conditions
must be identical to those quoted in the Rf data table, e.g. the same temperature and the same solvent
used.

Figure 30.6: How to calculate Rf values, which are then compared with reference values obtained under identical
conditions.

Coloured substances can be seen directly on the paper but others are sprayed with a chemical that forms
coloured compounds on the chromatogram. For example, amino acids can be revealed as bluish spots by
ninhydrin spray.

Partition coefficients in chromatography
The principle of partition of a solute between two solvents (see Section 21.6) helps us to understand more
fully how the components in a mixture are separated in chromatography.
In paper chromatography the different partition coefficients of the components in a mixture correspond to

their relative solubilities in the two solvents. The mobile phase is the solvent chosen. The other solvent is
the water trapped in the paper’s structure, which is the stationary phase. Figure 30.7 shows solute
molecules partitioned between the mobile phase and a stationary liquid phase on a solid support.
The solutes in the mixture being separated are partitioned to different extents between the solvents in the
mobile and stationary phases. The greater the relative solubility in the mobile phase, the faster the rate of
movement as the mobile phase passes over the stationary phase.

Figure 30.7: Partition paper chromatography. The mobile phase (solvent) moves over the stationary liquid phase (water
trapped between the paper fibres), carrying solute particles with it. The filter paper is the solid support in paper
chromatography.

in ethanol?

Work out the Rf value of the ink whose partition coefficient in ethanol and water lies between the
values of the other two inks.

Share your answers to Question 1 with another learner and explain your reasoning to each other. Then
mark each other’s answers using the answers provided.

30.2 Thin-layer chromatography
In thin-layer chromatography, referred to as TLC, the stationary phase is a solid that adsorbs the solute
molecules under investigation onto its surface (Figure 30.9).

Figure 30.9: Adsorption thin-layer chromatography. The mobile phase moves over the stationary solid phase.

The solid stationary phase is usually alumina (Al2O3), which is made into a slurry with water and spread
onto a microscope slide. This is then put into an oven, where it dries out into a solid white coating on the
glass. A chromatogram is then made in a similar way to paper chromatography (Figure 30.10).

PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 30.1
Making a thin-layer chromatogram

Figure 30.10: Thin-layer chromatography.

You can measure the distance from the baseline (the centre of the original mixture) to the solvent front
(the height the solvent front rises to). Then measure the distance between the baseline and the centre
of each solute. Using this information, you can then calculate the Rf values of the solutes.
Polar molecules have a greater attraction for a polar solid used as the stationary phase, and they are
adsorbed more strongly onto its surface. Therefore, they travel more slowly up the thin layer of aluminium
oxide, and separation occurs. Solutes are located on the chromatogram and identified by comparing with
standard known substances or by calculating Rf values.
Note that although TLC is normally described as adsorption chromatography, some partitioning does occur
if water is present. Dried aluminium oxide can become rehydrated. When this happens, water also acts as a
partitioning stationary phase together with the adsorbing stationary solid phase.
TLC is quicker than paper chromatography and can be used on smaller samples, making it useful in
forensic science, where it can be used to identify drugs and explosive residues.
For example, when forensic scientists use TLC to analyse a substance that is suspected to be cannabis, the
stationary phase is silicon dioxide (silica) sprayed with silver nitrate solution, which is then dried. The
mobile phase is the non-polar solvent methylbenzene.

Question
2

a

TLC can separate mixtures of components. What do we call the mechanism of separation usually
at work in TLC?

b

A mixture of propanone and hexane was separated on a TLC chromatogram using aluminium
oxide as the stationary phase and methylbenzene as the solvent. Which substance would you
expect to rise further up the chromatogram? Discuss your reasoning with another learner, then
write down your answer.

30.3 Gas–liquid chromatography
In gas–liquid chromatography (GLC), a gaseous sample under investigation enters a long column.

IMPORTANT
The column contains the stationary phase and the sample is moved through by an inert carrier gas. In
a mixture, the components will move through the column at different rates
This method can be used with gases, and volatile liquids or solids (as they must be in the form of a
vapour).
The apparatus is shown in Figure 30.10.
The stationary phase is a non-volatile liquid that has a high boiling point. This is often a long-chain, nonpolar hydrocarbon, bonded onto a solid support, e.g. small particles of silica packed tightly into a column.
The mobile phase is an inert (unreactive) ‘carrier’ gas, such as helium or nitrogen.
The tiny solid particles in the column have a very large surface area over which partitioning can occur,
resulting in excellent separation.
The more non-polar components in the mixture have a greater relative interaction with the non-polar liquid
on the solid particles (stationary phase). Therefore, they are carried through the column more slowly than
components whose molecules are more polar.
The detector at the end of the column records retention times, i.e. how long it takes each component to
pass through the column.

Figure 30.11: Gas–liquid chromatography (GLC). The oven maintains a constant temperature, higher than the boiling
point of the components in the mixture to be analysed.

Figure 30.12: A gas chromatogram from a mixture of volatile organic compounds.

As in all chromatography, the conditions must be controlled in order to make comparisons with published
databases. The chromatogram must be obtained using the same carrier gas, flow rate of gas, stationary
phase and temperature that were used when the standard data was obtained.
Figure 30.12 shows a chromatogram obtained using GLC.
Analysis by gas–liquid chromatography does have some limitations. For example, similar compounds will
have similar retention times. Also, if a newly discovered compound is detected, it will not have a match in
the computer’s database of retention times.

Determination of the percentage composition of a mixture by
GLC
For quantitative analysis, the component peaks are first identified and then the area of each is measured.
The peaks are roughly triangular in shape so their area is approximately:
× base × height (i.e. the area of a triangle)
The GLC machine usually measures the area of the peak automatically and can print the results with the
chromatogram. If the peaks are very narrow or have similar base widths, then peak height may be used
instead of peak area to estimate the proportion of components in a mixture.
For this method:
the chromatogram must show peaks for all the components in the mixture
all the components of the mixture must be separated
the detector must respond equally to the different components so that peak area is directly
proportional to the component concentration.
The amount of each component in a mixture is found by expressing it as a percentage of the sum of the
areas under all the peaks.
For example, for a mixture of three esters A, B and C:
(approx.) % of ester A

GLC is used to test for steroids in competing athletes and to test the fuels used in Formula One motor
racing (Figure 30.13). It is also used for medical diagnosis in analysing blood samples. With GLC, it is
possible to determine the percentages of dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
in blood samples as small as 1.0 cm3.
GLC is often combined with mass spectrometry to separate then rapidly identify the components of a
mixture.

Figure 30.13: GLC is used to check that the components in the fuel used in Grand Prix cars conform to strict regulations.

30.4 Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance
How NMR works
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a widely used analytical technique for organic
compounds. NMR uses the fact that the nucleus of each hydrogen atom in an organic molecule behaves
like a tiny magnet. The nucleus of a hydrogen atom consists of a single proton. This proton can spin. The
spinning motion of the positively charged proton causes a very small magnetic field to be set up.
In NMR we put the sample to be analysed in a magnetic field. The hydrogen nuclei (protons) either line up
with the field or, by spinning in the opposite direction, line up against the magnetic field (Figure 30.14).

Figure 30.14: Hydrogen (1H) nuclei will line up with or against a magnetic field.

There is a tiny difference in energy between the oppositely spinning 1H nuclei. This difference corresponds
to the energy carried by waves in the radiowave range of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. In NMR
spectroscopy, the nuclei ‘flip’ between the two energy levels (Figure 30.15). Only atoms whose mass
number is an odd number, e.g. 1H or 13C, absorb energy in the range of frequencies that is analysed.

Figure 30.15: Hydrogen (1H) nuclei will absorb energy in the radiowave range when they ‘flip’ from the lower energy
level, lining up with the applied magnetic field, to the higher energy level, lining up against it.

The size of the gap between the nuclear energy levels varies slightly, depending on the location of other
atoms in the molecule (the molecular environment). Therefore, NMR can be used to identify 1H atoms in
different parts of a molecule.
You will find this easier to understand by looking at an example. If we look at a molecule of methanol,
CH3OH, we can see that there are 1H atoms in two different molecular environments. We have 1H atoms in
both the ─CH3 group and the ─OH group. The energy absorbed by the 1H atoms in ─CH3 is different from
the energy absorbed by the 1H atom in ─OH.
In NMR spectroscopy, we vary the magnetic field as that is easier than varying the wavelength of radio
waves. As the magnetic field is varied, the 1H nuclei in different molecular environments flip at different
field strengths. The different field strengths are measured relative to a reference compound, which is given
a value of zero. The standard compound chosen is tetramethylsilane (TMS).
TMS is chosen because it is an inert, volatile liquid that mixes well with most organic compounds. Also, its
formula is Si(CH3)4, so all its H atoms are equivalent (i.e. they are all in the same molecular environment).
So, importantly, TMS only gives one sharp absorption, called a peak, and this peak is at a higher frequency
than most other protons (Figure 30.16). All other absorptions are measured by their shift away from the
sharp TMS peak on the NMR spectrum. This is called the chemical shift (δ), and is measured in units of
parts per million (ppm).

Figure 30.16: The standard TMS peak used as a reference on NMR spectra.

Question
Discuss the following questions in a small group before writing your answers.

a

Explain why tetramethylsilane (TMS) is used as a standard in NMR spectroscopy.

b

In NMR we use solvents such as tetrachloromethane to prepare samples for the machine (Figure
30.17).
i

Give the molecular formula of tetrachloromethane.

ii

Suggest why tetrachloromethane is used as a solvent when preparing samples for NMR
analysis.

iii

Solvents that contain deuterium, D, are also used as solvents in NMR. Deuterium is the 2H
isotope of hydrogen. A substance in which 1H is replaced by 2H is said to be deuterated.
Suggest why the deuterated solvent CDCl3 would be used instead of CHCl3.

Figure 30.17: Samples dissolved in a solvent in narrow tubes ready for NMR analysis.

Low-resolution NMR
A low-resolution NMR spectrum shows a single peak for each non-equivalent hydrogen atom; an example is
shown in Figure 30.18.

Figure 30.18: low-resolution NMR spectrum of ethanol, CH3CH2OH.

Note how the zero reference point on the x-axis, chemical shift (δ), is on the right of the spectrum and the
shift increases in value going left.
There are three peaks on ethanol’s low-resolution NMR spectrum. These correspond to the 1H atoms in
─OH, ─CH2─ and ─CH3.
Note how the heights of the three peaks vary. The area under each peak tells us the relative number of
equivalent 1H atoms responsible for that particular chemical shift. The largest peak will be from the ─CH3
hydrogen atoms, the middle peak from the ─CH2─ hydrogen atoms and the smallest peak from the ─OH
hydrogen. The relative areas under the peaks are shown on the NMR spectrum by the labels 1H, 2H and 3H
(see Figure 30.17).
The type of H atom present can be checked against tables of data (Table 30.1) if you are using NMR to
identify unknown organic compounds.

represent an aromatic ring.

Using Table 30.1 we can see that:
the peak at about 1.2 ppm is caused by the ─CH3 hydrogen atoms (range 0.9–1.7 ppm)
the peak at about 3.7 ppm corresponds to ─CH2─ hydrogen atoms (range 3.2–4.0 ppm)
the peak at about 5.4 ppm is due to the ─OH hydrogen atom.

Now check your answers against those provided to see if you were correct.

High-resolution NMR
As you can see in Table 30.1, the chemical shifts are given over ranges, and the ranges for different types
of hydrogen atoms do overlap. In some molecules where there is heavy shielding of the hydrogen nuclei by
lots of electrons in surrounding atoms, peaks are shifted beyond their usual range. In such cases highresolution NMR is useful.
High-resolution NMR gives us more information to interpret. Peaks that appear as one ‘signal’ on a lowresolution NMR spectrum are often revealed to be made up of a cluster of closely grouped peaks. This is
because the magnetic fields generated by spinning nuclei interfere slightly with those of neighbouring
nuclei.
This interference is called spin–spin coupling. The exact splitting pattern of a peak depends on the
number of hydrogen atoms on the adjacent carbon atom or atoms.

IMPORTANT
number of signals a peak splits into = n + 1 where n is the number of 1H atoms on the adjacent carbon
atom.
We can use the high-resolution NMR spectrum of ethanol to illustrate this ‘n + 1 rule’. The ‘n + 1 rule’ will
help you to interpret splitting patterns (Figure 30.19).
The ─CH3 peak is split into three because there are two 1H atoms on the adjacent ─CH2─ group.
n + 1 = 3 (as n = 2)
This splitting pattern is called a triplet.
The ─CH2─ peak is split into four because there are three 1H atoms on the adjacent ─CH3 group.
n + 1 = 4 (as n = 3)
This splitting is called a quartet.
The ─OH peak is not usually split as its 1H atom is constantly being exchanged with the 1H atoms of
other ethanol molecules and any water present. This results in one average peak being produced.
Table 30.2 shows the relative intensities and distribution of the splitting patterns you are likely to meet.
Figure 30.20 shows another high-resolution NMR spectrum. You should try to interpret it by following these
steps:

Step 1: Use δ values (chemical shift in ppm) to identify the environment of the equivalent protons (1H
atoms) present at each peak (remembering the peak at zero is the TMS standard reference peak).
Step 2: Look at the relative areas under each peak to determine how many of each type of non-equivalent
protons (1H atoms) are present.
Step 3: Apply the n + 1 rule to the splitting patterns to see which protons (1H atoms) are on adjacent
carbon atoms in the unknown molecule.
Step 4: Put all this information together to identify the unknown molecule.

Figure 30.19: The high-resolution NMR spectrum of ethanol, showing the splitting pattern in two of the peaks. The area
under each series of peaks still represents the number of equivalent 1H atoms in the molecule, as in low-resolution NMR.

WORKED EXAMPLE
1

An ester is used as a solvent in a glue. A chemist was given a sample of the ester to analyse. The
NMR spectrum of the ester is shown in Figure 30.20. Identify the ester.

Solution
Step 1:

Step 2:

Identify possibilities for the three major peaks that appear at chemical shifts of 1.3, 2.2
and 3.9 ppm. Using Table 30.1, these could be:
1.3 ppm

R─CH3, R─CH2─, R2>CH─

2.2 ppm

possibly H3C─CO─, RCH2CO─ or R2CH─CO─

3.9 ppm

O─CH3, O─CH2R, O─CHR2

Use the relative numbers of each type of proton (1H atom), labelling each major peak to
narrow down possibilities.
1.3 ppm, labelled 3H, so could be R─CH3
2.2 ppm, labelled 3H, so could be H3C─CO─
3.9 ppm, labelled 2H, so could be O─CH2R

Step 3:

By applying the n + 1 rule to the splitting patterns we can see which protons (1H
atoms) are on adjacent carbon atoms.
1.3 ppm, labelled 3H and split into triplet, so R─CH3 would be next to a C atom bonded
to two 1H atoms (2 + 1 = 3, triplet) i.e. R = ─CH2─.
2.2 ppm, labelled 3H and a singlet, so H3C─CO─ would be next to a C atom with no 1H
atoms attached (0 + 1 = 1, singlet). It could well be that the carbonyl carbon, ─CO─, is
also bonded to an ─O─ atom, as in an ester, i.e. H3C─COOR.
3.9 ppm, labelled 2H and split into a quartet, O─CH2R would be next to a C atom
bonded to three 1H atoms (3 + 1 = 4, quartet), i.e. R = ─CH3.

Step 4:

Putting this information together we get the ester ethyl ethanoate, CH3COOCH2CH3.

Question
If possible, work as a small group to discuss and answer this question.
6

A pathologist was given a sample of a white tablet to identify. In order to complete her report, the
pathologist received an NMR spectrum of the sample (Figure 30.21a) and information from the police
that the tablets involved were either aspirin or paracetamol. The displayed formulae of both drugs are
also shown in Figure 30.21b.
a

Using this information, identify the drug in the white tablet. Explain your answer.

b

Sketch the NMR spectrum you would expect to see if the other drug had undergone NMR analysis.
Label each peak with its relative area and the type of proton (1H) that caused it.

Figure 30.21: a NMR analysis of the unknown drug sample. b Structures of aspirin and paracetamol.

Identifying the ─OH or ─NH signal in an NMR spectrum
The ─OH signal in the high-resolution NMR spectrum of ethanol appears as a single peak. As we have seen
earlier in this section, the peak is not split by the 1H atoms (protons) on the neighbouring ─CH2─ group. The
reason for this is that the ─OH proton exchanges very rapidly with protons in any traces of water (or acid)
present, as follows:
CH3CH2OH + HOH ⇌ CH3CH2OH + HOH
The hydrogen atoms involved in this reversible proton exchange have been coloured red and blue. The
exchange takes place so rapidly that the signal for the ─OH protons becomes a single peak. This exchange
also happens in amines and amides which contain the ─NH─ group.
Table 30.3 shows the chemical shift ranges for the different ─OH and ─NH─ signals.
As you can see from Table 30.1, these ranges overlap with the chemical shifts of other types of proton. The
signals can also appear outside the quoted ranges under certain conditions, e.g. choice of solvent or
concentration. This makes NMR spectra difficult to interpret.

Table 30.3: Chemical shift ranges for ─OH and ─NH─ protons in different molecular environments.

However, there is a technique for positively identifying ─OH or ─NH─ groups in a molecule. Their peaks
‘disappear’ from the spectra if you add a small amount of deuterium oxide, D2O, to the sample. The
deuterium atoms (2H) in D2O, called ‘heavy water’, exchange reversibly with the protons in the ─OH or
─NH─ groups.
For example:

─OH + D2O ⇌ ─OD + HOD
─NH─CO─ + D2O ⇌ ─ND ─CO─ + HOD
The deuterium atoms do not absorb in the same region of the electromagnetic spectrum as protons (1H
atoms). This makes the ─OH or ─NH─ signal disappear from the NMR spectrum. By checking against the
peaks in the original NMR spectrum without D2O, we can tell if the ─OH or ─NH─ groups are present in the
sample. The 1H atom in the ─OH or ─NH─ group is referred to as a ‘labile’ proton.

Question
7

a

Look back at Figure 30.19.
The high-resolution NMR spectrum shown is from a sample of ethanol containing traces of water.
Describe how the NMR spectrum would differ if D2O had been added to the sample of ethanol.

b

Look back at Question 6. How would repeating the NMR analysis using a solvent of D2O help the
pathologist distinguish between aspirin and paracetamol?

Did Questions 6 and 7 reveal any areas of proton NMR analysis that you need more practise on? You
can try Exam-style Questions 2–5 to interpret more 1H NMR spectra.

30.5 Carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy
In addition to proton NMR, carbon-13 NMR is another analytical tool used frequently by organic chemists.
The vast majority of carbon atoms in any organic compound will be the carbon-12 isotope. This isotope has
an even mass number (12). Therefore, it has no signal on an NMR spectrum, as NMR only works with atoms
with an odd mass number (such as 1H, as we have already seen).
However, about 1% of the carbon atoms in any sample of an organic compound will be the carbon-13
isotope. These 13C nuclei will interact with the magnetic field applied in NMR analysis, so any organic
compound can produce an NMR spectrum.
Typical carbon-13 NMR shifts are shown in Table 30.4. As in proton NMR, the chemical shifts are measured
with reference to the TMS (tetramethylsilane) peak at 0 ppm on the spectrum (see Section 30.4).

IMPORTANT
Carbon-13 NMR produces a spectrum with different chemical shifts for non-equivalent carbon atoms in
a molecule.

Table 30.4: Typical 13C chemical shift values (δ) relative to TMS = 0. Note that chemical shifts are typical values and can
vary slightly depending on the solvent, the concentration and substituents present.

Analysis of carbon-13 NMR spectra is similar to that of proton NMR, looking to match different chemical
shifts to characteristic molecular environments. However, the signals produced in carbon-13 NMR appear
as discrete vertical lines on the spectra. You do not find the complication of the splitting patterns caused by
the protons in 1H atoms within the molecules. Take care in interpreting the carbon-13 NMR spectra because
the heights of the lines are not usually proportional to the number of equivalent 13C atoms present.
The solvent used to prepare samples for 13C NMR analysis is CDCl3. This accounts for the small signal near
80 ppm that can be ignored when interpreting a spectrum, as it is caused by the atoms of 13C in the
solvent molecules.
Figure 30.22 shows the 13C NMR spectrum for propanone, (CH3)2CO.

Figure 30.22: The carbon-13 NMR spectrum of propanone.

Note that there are only two peaks: one for the carbon atom in the carbonyl group, –C═O, and the other for
the carbon atoms in the methyl groups, ─CH3. Although there are two ─CH3 groups in propanone, they are
equivalent and so appear as only a single peak (just as equivalent H atoms do in proton NMR).
Figure 30.23 shows another example; the carbon-13 NMR spectrum of ethylbenzene, C6H5CH2CH3.

Figure 30.23: The carbon-13 NMR spectrum of ethylbenzene.

The carbon atoms in the benzene ring are almost equivalent but will be affected to slightly different
extents by the presence of the ethyl group in the molecule. Hence the series of lines clustered between

SUMMARY
Chromatography separates mixtures of substances for identification. In chromatography, the mobile phase moves
the components of a mixture through or over the stationary phase. Separation occurs by the transfer of the
components to the stationary phase by:
partition between two liquids (due to the different solubility of solutes in the mobile phase and stationary phase),
or
partition between a gas and a liquid, or
adsorption on a solid surface.
The stationary phase may be solid or liquid; the mobile phase may be liquid or gas.
In paper and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) the components of a mixture are identified by their Rf values.
In gas-liquid chromatography (GLC), the components of a mixture are identified by their retention times; the
amount of each component is found by measuring the area under each peak (estimates can be made from narrow
or sharp peak heights).
The proton NMR spectrum of a compound provides detailed information about the structure of the compound. In
particular, the spectrum for the protons, 1H, in a compound can provide a complete determination of the
compound’s structure.
Protons in different chemical environments produce signals at different chemical shifts. The chemical shift δ
provides information about the proton’s environment.
Protons on neighbouring carbon atoms cause signals to be split. The splitting pattern establishes which groups of
protons are on adjacent carbon atoms. The ‘n + 1’ rule predicts the splitting pattern.
Protons on OH and NH can be identified by the addition of D2O to the NMR sample, which collapses the peak due to
an ‒OH or an ‒NH‒ proton.
Carbon-13 NMR can also help to determine the structure of organic molecules.
A combination of techniques, such as infrared (see Chapter 18), NMR and mass spectroscopy (see Chapter 3) must
be used to confirm the structure of newly discovered compounds.

Practical skills 2

P2.1 Introduction
The ability to plan, analyse and evaluate practical work requires higher-order thinking skills. You will need
plenty of practice in carrying out tasks requiring these skills as you progress through your course (Figure
P2.1).

Figure P2.1 Many chemists are employed to plan, carry out and evaluate tests on substances found in the environment.

Written examination of practical skills
Paper 5 in the Cambridge International A Level Chemistry syllabus is the written examination of practical
skills. It focuses on the higher-order experimental skills of planning, analysis and evaluation. Some
questions on this paper may be set in areas of chemistry that are difficult to investigate experimentally and
some may be based on new situations.
Before going through the following section, it would be a good idea to read Chapter P1, Practical skills 1.
This will remind you of the structure of investigations. This is essential to understand before you can apply
the higher-order practical skills tested in Paper 5.

P2.2 Planning
Expectations
Defining the problem
You should be able to:
identify the independent variable in the experiment or investigation
identify the dependent variable in the experiment or investigation
formulate the aim in terms of a prediction or hypothesis, and express this in words or in the form of a
predicted graph
identify the variables that are to be controlled.

Methods
You should be able to:
describe the method to be used to vary the independent variable, and the means that you propose to
ensure that you have measured its values accurately
describe how you will measure the dependent variable
describe how you will control each of the other key variables
explain how you will use any control experiments to verify that it is the independent variable that is
affecting the dependent variable and not some other factor
describe the arrangement of apparatus and the steps in the procedure to be followed
suggest appropriate volumes and concentrations of reagents
assess the risks of your proposed methods
describe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum
draw up tables for data that you might wish to record
describe how the data might be used in order to reach a conclusion.
As the expectations above show, all plans contain two distinct sections:
defining the problem
the actual method.

Defining the problem
The question generally begins with a stem, which will contain information relevant to the plan and the aim
of the investigation. The context of the task to be covered may or may not be familiar to you, but the stem
will contain all the detail required.
Almost invariably, a prediction is required and, together with an explanation of the basis of the prediction,
they form a hypothesis to test. For example, in a question about rate of reaction, you might make a
quantitative prediction, such as the direct proportionality between the rate and concentration. Here, the
supporting explanation would need to be given in terms of the doubling of the frequency of particle
collisions as a result of doubling the concentration. The planning question might also ask you to give a
supporting sketch graph.
You will have to specify the independent and the dependent variables. You might also have to consider the
need to control other variables.
In a ‘rate’ exercise, the independent variable might be the concentration of a reactant or the temperature.
The measured rate of the reaction at different values of the independent variable is the dependent
variable. Alternative ways of measuring the rate of reaction, such as the time to collect a set volume of gas
(giving average rates) or the monitoring of gas released over time (then calculating the initial gradient of
lines on a graph to measure initial rates), are acceptable.

Methods
When creating a method, you should produce one that can be followed by another learner without the need
to ask any extra questions. This means that fine detail is required and nothing should be left out just
because you think it is ‘obvious’.
The question might provide further information that builds on the stem, but you are expected to have
experience of basic laboratory apparatus. The best way to achieve this is to follow a programme of
experimental work throughout the course. This also has the advantage of promoting the understanding of
concepts underlying the practical work.
Basic techniques, such as titrations, standard solution production and rate measurement, should be
thoroughly understood in detail. You also need to be aware of the various methods of measuring volume
and mass available in a laboratory. For example, an experiment involving the production and collection of a
gas, such as the effect of heat on nitrates, would require you to be aware that gas syringes usually have a
maximum capacity of 100 cm3. An alternative method to collect the gas over water in a burette would
allow for the collection of only 50 cm3. This example shows how it is important to perform meaningful
practical work in order to prepare for Paper 5. There is no substitute for familiarity in handling real
apparatus.
On occasion, you could be asked to draw a diagram of the apparatus to be used. You need to be able to
represent the apparatus in a simple and understandable format. It is essential that each piece of
equipment can be easily recognised in the diagram. Practice drawing sessions are a very good idea.
Relevant calculations are an almost routine requirement, and these must be logically presented, step by
step.
The preparation of a standard solution of a solid acid, such as ethanedioic acid, requires the calculation of
the mass to be dissolved in a chosen volumetric flask in order to produce the required concentration. The
described procedure should indicate that the solid needs to be dissolved completely in distilled water
before adding the solution to the volumetric flask (see Figure P2.2). You should make clear how you can
ensure that all of this solution is transferred successfully to the volumetric flask. For example, you would
rinse any solution stuck on the inside of the original container into the volumetric flask using distilled
water. Once in the volumetric flask, the solution is made up to the required mark, and must then be
thoroughly mixed.

Figure P2.2 Volumetric flasks are used to make up standard solutions of known concentration accurately.

You are expected to calculate the amounts of substance used to suit the volume or size of the apparatus
that you specify. For example, if the plan involves collecting a gas from the decomposition of a carbonate in
a 100 cm3 gas syringe, the calculated mass of the solid to be heated should be such as to produce slightly
less than 100 cm3 of the gas.
An important part of any plan is the collection and presentation of results. Any processing of the results
must be specified, and the figures obtained should also be presented as the ‘derived results’. The derived
results may then be processed in order to confirm or deny (falsify) the original prediction or hypothesis.
This processing may involve calculating means of repeat readings and the graphical presentation of results.
The recorded results are those collected from the various steps taken in carrying out the procedure. For
example, in an exercise to find the enthalpies of solution of Group 1 hydroxides, the necessary results
columns to be recorded are:

the name or nature of the hydroxide
the mass of a weighing bottle
the mass of the weighing bottle and a sample of the hydroxide
the initial temperature of the water
the final temperature of the solution.
If you plan to repeat any tests to get replicate results, extra columns must be added to the results table.
Each column should have the correct units: for example, represented as either ‘ / g’ or ‘(g)’ for any mass.
The next stage is to process the results:
1 calculate the mass of hydroxide used
2 calculate the number of moles of hydroxide used
3 calculate the number of joules of energy released into the solution
4 use the results to parts 2 and 3 to deduce the standard enthalpy change per mole of hydroxide.
All plans have to be assessed for risk. Examination questions can ask for:
an assessment of the risks involved in a particular experiment
how to deal with the risks
both of the above.
In an exercise to determine the enthalpy of neutralisation of hydrochloric acid (the question will tell you
that this is ‘harmful’) and sodium hydroxide (which is ‘corrosive’), you could be asked about a suitable
precaution. Alternatively, an experiment on solubility may have hot water as a possible hazard. If a toxic
gas is formed, as in the decomposition of Group 2 nitrates, the investigation should be carried out in a
fume hood.
Points to remember
When planning an investigation, your method must be ordered in a logical sequence. Therefore, you
might prefer to make some rough notes at the back of the examination paper before writing a bulletpointed list or flow chart that explains exactly how you would carry out the investigation. These could
include diagrams of the assembled apparatus instead of complicated written explanations of the setup.
When describing how to vary your independent variable, make sure that you consider how to measure
its values accurately. For example, in a rate of precipitation investigation, when varying the
concentration of a solution, you might choose to measure volumes of water and solution using
volumetric pipettes and fillers rather than just using a measuring cylinder (see Figure P2.3). You should
also be familiar with the volumes and masses of reagents that are reasonable to use in normal
everyday laboratory work. For example, a volume of 15 cm3 of solution would be suitable for an
experiment in a boiling tube but not in a 250 cm3 conical flask.
When deciding how to measure the dependent variable, you should also consider accuracy: how you
intend to measure its ‘true’ value. In a rate of precipitation investigation, you might choose to carry out
the reaction in a conical flask on top of a piece of paper with a pencil mark drawn on it. You could then
time how long it takes for the pencil mark to be no longer visible when viewed from above the flask.
This will involve a subjective judgement by the observer. If you have done an experiment like this
before, you will know just how difficult it is to decide the exact moment when you can no longer see
through the solution. So including a very accurate timing device, reading to one-thousandth of a
second, would not be appropriate for this method.
You might also be required to sketch the axes you would use to graph the data collected and describe
how you would use the data to draw a conclusion.

Figure P2.3 Volumetric and graduated pipettes are used to transfer accurate volumes of liquid. Volumetric pipettes give
greater accuracy than graduated pipettes, due to the single line to measure to on the thin section above the bulge.

P2.3 Analysis, conclusions and evaluation
Expectations
Dealing with data
You should be able to:
identify the calculations and means of presentation of data that are necessary to be able to draw
conclusions from provided data
use calculations to enable simplification or explanation of data
use tables and graphs to draw attention to the key points in quantitative data, including the variability
of data.

Evaluation
You should be able to:
identify anomalous values in provided data and suggest appropriate means of dealing with such
anomalies
within familiar contexts, suggest possible explanations for anomalous readings
identify the extent to which provided readings have been adequately replicated, and describe the
adequacy of the range of data provided
use provided information to assess the extent to which selected variables have been effectively
controlled.

Conclusions
You should be able to:
draw conclusions from an investigation, providing a detailed description of the key features of the data
and analyses, and considering whether experimental data supports a given hypothesis
make detailed scientific explanations of the data, analyses and conclusions that you have described
make further predictions, ask informed and relevant questions and suggest improvements.

P2.4 The three remaining skills
The three remaining skills are Dealing with data, Evaluation and Conclusions. You should revise Section
P1.4 before reading the following advice.

Dealing with data
In a written practical paper, you will often be presented with some data, usually in a table, derived from an
experiment. The details of the experiment will be given to you, and then you will be asked to process the
data and produce a system that incorporates all the results and allows not only correct patterns to become
apparent but also detects anomalous results. The tabulated results will be the measured quantities of the
processes carried out in a laboratory.
For example, in an experiment to confirm the formula of zinc iodide by reacting excess zinc with iodine, the
measurements would be:
mass of an empty test-tube
mass of the test-tube and zinc powder
mass of the test-tube, zinc powder and iodine
mass of the test-tube and excess of zinc.
From these you would calculate:
the mass of zinc used
the mass of iodine that reacted with that mass of zinc.
These results would be tabulated, possibly alongside the original data, with each column showing the
appropriate units and an expression to show how the values were calculated.
All calculations should be correct and recorded to an appropriate number of significant figures and / or
decimal places. The question will sometimes tell you the degree of accuracy required, but often you will
need to decide this yourself.
Many balances weigh to the nearest 0.01 g, and hence masses should be recorded to 2 decimal places,
remembering that whole number masses should be recorded to the same accuracy, e.g. 4.00 g. In other
circumstances, derived data should be recorded to the same number of significant figures as the least
accurate item of supplied data. Where you are in doubt, 3 significant figures is appropriate for most
calculations.
Having processed the raw data, the next step involves either a series of calculations to be averaged or
some form of graphical plot.
In the zinc iodide experiment already discussed, the ratio of the number of moles of iodine to the number
of moles of zinc can be used to produce a series of ratios.
These ratios can then either be averaged, excluding any anomalies, to produce an appropriate result, or a
graph could be plotted of the two molar values. In this case, the appropriate gradient of the line would
indicate the formula of zinc iodide. For example, if you plot the number of moles of zinc on the x-axis and
the number of moles of iodine on the y-axis, the gradient of the line on the graph should be 2. This shows
that the formula of zinc iodide is ZnI2.
The first step in plotting a graph is an appropriate choice of scales for the two axes, with the independent
variable along the x-axis (the horizontal axis). When choosing a suitable scale, it is useful to remember that
the plotted points should be spread over at least half of each axis.
You must decide whether or not the origin (0,0) is a point on your graph. Whether or not to include the
origin will usually be clear from the nature of the results. For example, if the concentration of a reactant is
shown to affect the rate of a reaction, it is reasonable to assume that if the reactant were absent the
reaction would not occur, so the rate would be zero when the concentration was zero. The origin can then
provide a further useful point to be plotted. Chosen scales should be easily readable, but errors are
counted if unhelpful scales are used. For example, the division of each of the two-centimetre squares on
the graph grid into three makes accurate plotting very difficult.

Each of the plotted points can best be shown as a small x or +, made with a hard, sharp, pencil.
Most plotted points will show a clear trend, indicating whether the graph should be a straight line or a
curve; a straight line is the more usual. The plotted points must first be assessed to identify any anomalous
points. If any anomalous points are identified, they should be clearly labelled as such. The line of best fit is
then drawn, either as a curve or straight line. This line may not pass through all, or indeed any, of the
plotted points. As a rough guide, an equal number of points should lie on the left of the line and on the
right of the line, producing an ‘average’ line.

Evaluation
You can approach the evaluation of a set of results in a number of ways. The aim of any experiment is to
draw an appropriate conclusion, either to verify a relationship or to establish a new relationship. This is
accomplished by looking at the nature of the results and the quality of the experiment itself.
When anomalous results are identified, they should be clearly labelled as such. The source of the anomaly
will often need to be identified and will usually fall into one of two categories: either a positive or a
negative deviation from the general trend.
In a reaction involving the reduction of a metal oxide, the anomaly might arise because the reduction was
incomplete, leading to a larger than expected mass of metal. The excess mass is the unreacted oxide.
If the reaction involves the thermal decomposition of hydrated iron(II) sulfate, two opposite errors are
possible:
insufficient heating: this will cause the residual mass to be too great
overheating: this will cause the residual mass to be too small.
The former result corresponds to the incomplete removal of the water of crystallisation, whereas the latter
relates to the decomposition of the iron(II) sulfate into iron oxide.
You may be called upon to consider whether the actual experimental data under consideration is of high
enough quality to produce reliable results, and appropriate improvements may be requested. If the results
provide poor support for a conclusion, it may be that further repeats are needed, or that the range of
results needs to be extended.
Apparatus may need to considered from two viewpoints:
is it appropriate?
is it accurate?
In the measurement of volume, burettes and pipettes are more accurate than measuring cylinders, but if
the volume to be measured is large, a measuring cylinder could be perfectly adequate.
An experiment measuring a small temperature change in an enthalpy exercise often involves volumes of
the order of 25 cm3 to 50 cm3 and a typical temperature change of the order of 5 °C to 10 °C, using a
thermometer accurate to the nearest degree. In this case, the volumes could safely be measured with a
measuring cylinder, as the percentage error of the temperature change will be greater than that of the
measuring cylinder.
The volumes measured during titrations are about as accurate as simple exercises can be. If these are
involved in an experiment the source of any error is likely to be elsewhere.
Measuring small volumes or masses generally produces high percentage errors, whichever item of simple
laboratory apparatus is used. As an example, an experiment to investigate the rate of reaction between
hydrochloric acid and magnesium by measuring the volume of hydrogen produced requires less than 0.10
g of magnesium if the gas produced is to be collected in a 100 cm3 syringe. This is a very small mass of
magnesium. Using a typical balance accurate to 0.01 g would give a 10% error and consequently the
accuracy of the syringe is of negligible significance. The error in measuring the mass of the magnesium will
be the greatest percentage error.

Conclusions
The conclusion of an exercise draws upon the key features of data collected and the subsequent analyses.
Usually the data given will support a given hypothesis. However, it must be clearly understood that data
that do not support an initial suggestion might also have to be considered.

In the magnesium / acid reaction, processing could involve plotting a graph of rate against the relative
concentration of the acid. Inspection of the graph would allow a deduction to be made about the order with
respect to [H+] in the rate equation. This conclusion would then be considered in the light of an original
hypothesis. This, in turn, could lead to further predictions and experiments (see Section P1.4 in Chapter
P1).
If the experiment is considered to be too approximate, suggested improvements to the exercise might be
requested.
Points to remember
Calculations involving data collected may ask for the mean, median, mode, percentage loss or percentage
gain.
To calculate the mean, add up the individual values in a set and divide by the number of values. Take
care not to quote the mean to an unrealistic number of significant figures. The mean should reflect the
precision of the measurements from which it was calculated.
The median is the middle result when all the results are put in order of magnitude.
The mode is the most common value.
Percentage loss or gain is calculated by dividing the actual loss or gain by the original value, then
multiplying by 100.
The interval of the independent variable should be consistent when planning an investigation. However,
additional values can be selected to look more closely where a pattern seems to change (e.g. the gradient
of a line changes on a graph of your results) or to extend the limits of your original range below its
minimum value or above its maximum value. For example, you might decide to test a much lower dilution
of 0.01 mol dm−3 when investigating the effect of concentration on the rate of reaction. This would enable
you to test if the trend you see within your original range of data continues as expected.

Question
2

In the experiment described in Question 1, a learner weighed a mass of 11.35 g of the oxide of
copper on a balance reading to the nearest 0.05 g. What was the percentage error in this
measurement?

b

Another group of learners carrying out the same experiment found that their sample of the oxide
of copper contained 13.24 g of copper and 3.26 g of oxygen. What is the most likely formula of
the oxide of copper? (Relative atomic mass of Cu = 63.5; O = 16.0.)

c

Nine out of the ten groups who tackled the experiment obtained results consistent with those of
the group described in part b. The other group’s measurements resulted in a ratio that suggested
the formula of the oxide was Cu2O.

SUMMARY
In the written practical examination, you will be tested on your skills of planning, analysis and evaluation.
The planning skill can be split into two sections.
a

Defining the problem, where you should:
identify the independent variable, the dependent variable, and the variables that are to be controlled in the
experiment or investigation
formulate a prediction or hypothesis, and

b

Describing a method.

The analysis and evaluation skills include:
using calculations to simplify or explain data
using tables and graphs to interpret data
identifying and dealing with anomalous data
considering the precision of data
assessing the control of variables in tests.
making detailed explanations of the data, analyses and conclusions
making further predictions, asking questions and suggesting improvements.

EXAM-STYLE QUESTIONS
1

Diffusion in a gas is the random motion of particles involved in the net movement of a substance
from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The process of diffusion also
takes place in solution. Medical scientists are interested in the rate of diffusion of pharmaceutical
compounds through tumours. They can model the factors that affect the rate of diffusion of these
drugs by conducting investigations using coloured compounds (to model the drugs) and gelatin, a
jelly-like substance (to model the tumours).
The kinetic energy of particles depends on their mass and the speed they travel at. So at a given
temperature, large particles will travel slower on average than smaller particles.
Imagine that you are a member of a research team trying to find out how the rate of diffusion
through gelatin depends on the relative molecular mass (Mr) of a drug.

The research team can make thin discs of gelatin to cover the central area of Petri
dishes, leaving space around the edge of each disc to place a solution of the coloured
dyes under investigation.

You have been given five coloured powders of dyes, labelled A to E, to test. These have
relative molecular masses of 486, 534, 686, 792 and 886, respectively. You are also
provided with a stopclock / watch and a ruler with a millimetre scale. You can also use
any other common laboratory apparatus needed to complete the investigation. The
diffusion is a slow process and the team carry out some trial runs to get a rough idea
how quickly the dyes diffuse through the gelatin. They decide to monitor the experiment
for 72 hours.
Consider the information above and describe how you would carry out the experiment,
making sure that you include:
how to ensure the same number of dye molecules is used in each test
how to ensure that the Petri dish is kept under the same conditions throughout all of
the experiments to measure the rate of diffusion
how to produce reliable results.

[6]

d

Two of the dyes are classified as ‘harmful’ and are hazardous if absorbed through the
skin or are inhaled. State any precautions you would take to minimise the risk.

e

Draw a table with headings that show clearly the data you would record when carrying
out your experiments and any values you would need to calculate in order to construct a
graph to check your prediction in part a. The headings must include the appropriate
[2]
units. Ensure that the table covers all the detail relating to the five dyes listed in part c.
